<p><i>Transcriber's Note:</i> This book was published in 1800 and contains some
inconsistent spelling, capitalization, hyphenation, and punctuation
typical of that era. These have been retained as they appear in the
original, including the inconsistent use of a period after the pound
symbol (e.g., £.100 and £100). Inconsistent italicizing of <i>l.</i>, <i>s.</i>,
and <i>d.</i> has been normalized to italics. Long-s (&#383;) has been normalized to
s. Printer errors have been resolved with reference to a later and apparently corrected
printing of the same edition, available at the Internet Archive,
http://www.archive.org/details/atreatiseonpoli03colqgoog. Unresolved
printer errors are indicated with red dotted underlining; hover the

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>CCUPIED in a variety of laborious pursuits, which afford little time
either for study or recreation, the Author once more presents this
Work to the Public with an unfeigned Diffidence, arising from his
consciousness, that under such circumstances it must require their
indulgence. This, he trusts, will be granted when it is considered,
that his employments are of a nature unfriendly to that critical
accuracy and precision, the necessity of which is impressed on his
mind, not less by a sense of his own personal character, than of his
obligations to the long-experienced candour and liberality of his
readers.</p>

<p>In the present Edition much new matter has been brought forward, and
considerable improvements have been attempted by the introduction of
official facts, and authentic details calculated to elucidate and
explain the general system first placed by the Author under the review
of the Public. Their extensive approbation (although his only reward)
is of a nature which can never be too highly estimated. That
approbation has not only been confirmed by many of the first and most
respectable characters in these kingdoms, not less conspicuous for
talents and abilities than for that genuine patriotism which
distinguishes the good subject, and the valuable member of Society;
but also by several Foreigners eminent for learning and virtue.</p>

<p>While we deplore the miserable condition of those numerous delinquents
who have unfortunately multiplied with the same rapidity that the
great wealth of the Metropolis has increased: while their errors and
their crimes are exposed only for the purpose of amendment: while the
tear of pity is due to their forlorn state, a prospect happily opens
through the medium of <i>the Report of the</i> <span class="smcap">Select Committee</span> <i>of the</i>
<span class="smcap">House</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Commons</span>, for the adoption of those remedies which will
unquestionably give a seasonable check to immorality and delinquency;
so as by their prevention not only to protect the rights of innocence,
but also increase the number of the useful members of the community,
and render punishments less frequent and necessary.</p>

<p>To witness the ultimate completion of legislative arrangements,
operating so favourably to the immediate advantage and security of the
Metropolis, and extending also similar benefits to the country at
large, will prove to the Author of this Work a very great and genuine
source of happiness.</p>

<p>To the Public, therefore, in general, and to the Legislature in
particular, does he look forward with confidence for that singular
gratification which, by giving effect to his well-meant endeavours for
the prevention of Crimes, will ultimately crown with success the
exertions he has used in the course of a very intricate and laborious
investigation, in which his only object has been the good of his
country.</p>

<h2><span class="gesperrt">PREFACE.</span></h2>

<hr class="dbl1" />
<hr class="dbl2" />

<p><span class="cap">P</span>OLICE in this Country may be considered as a <i>new Science</i>; the
properties of which consist not in the Judicial Powers which lead to
<i>Punishment</i>, and which belong to Magistrates alone; but in the
<span class="smcap">Prevention</span> and <span class="smcap">Detection of Crimes</span>, and in those other Functions which
relate to <span class="smcap">internal Regulations</span> for the well ordering and comfort of
Civil Society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Police of the Metropolis</span>, in every point of view, is a subject of
great importance to be known and understood; since every innocent and
useful Member of the Community has a particular interest in the
correct administration of whatever relates to the Morals of the
People, and to the protection of the Public against Fraud and
Depredation.</p>

<p>Under the present circumstances of insecurity, with respect to
property and even life itself, this is a subject which cannot fail to
force itself upon the attention of all:&mdash;All are equally concerned in
the Information which this Work conveys; the chief part of the
details in which are entirely novel, not to be found in books, and
never laid before the Public through the medium of the Press, previous
to the first Publication of this Treatise.</p>

<p>It may naturally be imagined, that such an accumulation of delinquency
systematically detailed, and placed in so prominent a point of view,
must excite a considerable degree of astonishment in the minds of
those Readers who have not been familiar with subjects of this nature;
and hence a desire may be excited to investigate how far the amazing
extent of the Depredations upon the Public here related, can be
reconciled to reason and possibility.</p>

<p>Four years have, however, elapsed, since these details have been
before the Public, and they still stand on their original ground,
without any attempt which has come to the Author's knowledge, to
question the magnitude or the extent of the evil.&mdash;On the contrary,
new sources of Fraud and Depredation have been brought forward,
tending greatly to increase the general mass of Delinquency.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In revising the present Edition, the Author felt a strong impulse to
reduce his estimates; but after an attentive review of the whole,
excepting in the instances of the Depredations on Commercial Property,
(which have been greatly diminished by the establishment of a <i>Marine
Police</i>, applicable to that particular object,) he was unable to
perceive any ground for materially altering his original
calculations.&mdash;If some classes of Theft, Robbery, and Depredation,
have been reduced, others have been augmented; still leaving the
aggregate nearly as before.</p>

<p>The causes of these extensive and accumulated wrongs being fully
explained, and accounted for, in various parts of the Work; a very
short recapitulation of them is, therefore, all that is necessary in
this Preface.</p>

<p>The enlarged state of Society, the vast extent of moving property, and
the unexampled wealth of the Metropolis, joined to the depraved habits
and loose conduct of a great proportion of the lower classes of the
people; and above all, the want of an appropriate Police applicable to
the object of prevention, will, after a careful perusal of this work,
reconcile the attentive mind to a belief of the actual existence of
evils which could not otherwise have been credited.&mdash;Let it be
remembered also, that this Metropolis is unquestionably not only the
greatest Manufacturing and Commercial City in the world, but also the
general receptacle for the idle and depraved of almost every country;
particularly from every quarter of the dominions of the Crown&mdash;Where
the temptations and resources for criminal pleasures&mdash;Gambling, Fraud
and Depredation almost exceed imagination; since besides being the
seat of Government it is the centre of <i>fashion, amusements,
dissipation and folly</i>.</p>

<p>Under such peculiar circumstances, while immorality, licentiousness
and crimes are known to advance in proportion to the excessive
accumulation of wealth, it cannot fail to be a matter of deep regret,
that in the progressive increase of the latter the means of checking
the rapid strides of the former have not been sooner discovered and
effectually applied.</p>

<p>It is, however, earnestly to be hoped that it is not yet too
late.&mdash;Patriots and Philanthropists who love their country, and glory
in its prosperity, will rejoice with the Author in the prospect, that
the great leading features of improvement suggested and matured in the
present Edition of this Work will ultimately receive the sanction of
the Legislature.</p>

<p>May the Author be allowed to express his conviction that the former
Editions of this book tended in no small degree, to remove various
misconceptions on the subject of Police: and at the same time
evidently excited in the public mind a desire to see such remedies
applied as should contribute to the improvement of the Morals of the
People, and to the removal of the danger and insecurity which were
universally felt to exist?</p>

<p>An impression it is to be hoped is generally felt from the example of
the Roman Government, when enveloped in riches and luxury, that
National prosperity must be of short duration when public Morals are
too long neglected, and no effectual measures adopted for the purpose
either of checking the alarming growth of depravity, or of guarding
the rising generation against evil examples.</p>

<p>It is by the general influence of good Laws, aided by the regulations
of an energetic Police, that the blessings of true Liberty, and the
undisturbed enjoyment of Property are secured.</p>

<p>The sole object of the Author in pointing out the accumulated wrongs
which have tended in so great a degree to abridge this Liberty, is to
pave the way for the adoption of those practical remedies which he
has suggested, in conformity with the spirit of the Laws, and the
Constitution of the Country, for the purpose of bettering the state of
Society, and improving the condition of human life.</p>

<p>If in the accomplishment of this object the Morals of the People shall
undergo a favourable change, and that species of comfort and security
be extended to the inhabitants of this great Metropolis, which has not
heretofore been experienced, while many evils are prevented, which in
their consequences threaten to be productive of the most serious
mischief, the Author of this Work will feel himself amply rewarded in
the benefits which the System he has proposed shall be found to confer
upon the Capital of the British Dominions, and on the Nation at
large.</p>

<p><span class="cap">N</span>EXT to the blessings which a Nation derives from an excellent
Constitution and System of general Laws, are those advantages which
result from a well-regulated and energetic plan of Police, conducted
and enforced with purity, activity, vigilance, and discretion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">-2-</a></span></p>

<p>Upon this depends, in so great a degree, the comfort, the happiness,
and the true liberty and security of the People, that too much labour
and attention cannot possibly be bestowed in rendering complete the
domestic administration of Justice in all cases of criminal
delinquency.</p>

<p>That much remains to be done in this respect no person will deny; all
ranks must bear testimony to the dangers which both life and property
are at present subjected to by the number of criminal people, who,
from various causes (which it is the object of the Writer of these
pages to explain), are suffered with impunity to repeat acts of
licentiousness and mischief, and to commit depredations upon
individuals and the Public.</p>

<p>In vain do we boast of those liberties which are our birthright, if
the vilest and most depraved part of the Community are suffered to
deprive us of the privilege of travelling upon the highways, or of
approaching the Capital in any direction after dark, without risk of
being assaulted, and robbed; and perhaps wounded or murdered.</p>

<p>In vain may we boast of the security which our Laws afford us, if we
cannot lie down to rest in our habitations, without the dread of a
burglary being committed, our property invaded, and our lives exposed
to imminent danger before the approach of morning.</p>

<p>Imperfect must be either the plan or the execution, or both, of our
Criminal Code, if crimes are found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">-3-</a></span> to increase; if the moral
principle ceases to be a check upon a vast proportion of the lower
ranks of the People; and if small thefts are known to prevail in such
a degree, as to affect almost all ranks of the Community who have any
property to lose, as often as opportunities occur, whereby pilfering
in a little way can be effected without detection.</p>

<p>If, in addition to this, the peace of Society can, on every specious
pretence, be disturbed by the licentious clamours or turbulent
effusions arising from the ill-regulated passions of vulgar life,
surely it becomes an interesting inquiry, worthy the attention of
every intelligent member of the Community, <i>from what source spring
these numerous inconveniences; and where is a remedy to be found for
so many accumulated evils</i>?</p>

<p>In developing the causes which have produced that want of security,
which it is believed prevails in no other civilised country in so
great a degree as in England, it will be necessary to examine how far
the System of Criminal Jurisprudence has been, hitherto, applicable to
the prevention of crimes.</p>

<p>If we look back to the measures pursued by our ancestors two centuries
ago, and before that period, we shall find that many wholesome laws
were made with a view to prevention, and to secure the good behaviour
of persons likely to commit offences. Since that æra in our history, a
different plan has been pursued. Few regulations have been established
to restrain vice, or to render difficult the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">-4-</a></span> commission of crimes;
while the Statute Books have been filled with numerous Laws, in many
instances doubtfully expressed, and whose leading feature has
generally been severe punishment. These circumstances, aided by the
false mercy of Juries in cases of slight offences, have tended to let
loose upon Society a body of criminal individuals, who under a better
Police&mdash;an improved system of Legislation, and milder
punishments,&mdash;might, after a correction in Penitentiary Houses, or
employment in out-door labour, under proper restraints, have been
restored to Society as useful members.</p>

<p>As the Laws are at present administered, it is a melancholy truth not
to be contradicted, that the major part of the criminals who infest
this Metropolis, although committed by magistrates for trial on very
satisfactory proof, are returned upon the Public in vast numbers year
after year; encouraged to renew their former practices, by the
facility they experience in evading justice.</p>

<p>But this is not all:&mdash;The adroit Thief and Receiver, availing
themselves of their pecuniary resources, often escape, from their
knowledge of the tricks and devices which are practised, through the
medium of disreputable practitioners of the Law; while the novices in
delinquency generally suffer the punishment attached to conviction.
If, as is the case in some other countries, evidence were allowed to
be received of the general character of persons, put upon their trial
for offences, and the means by which they obtain their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">-5-</a></span> subsistence,
so as to distinguish the old reputed Thief and Receiver from the
novice in crimes, the minds of Jurymen would be often enlightened, to
the furtherance of substantial justice; and a humane and proper
distinction might be made between the young pupil of depravity, and
the finished villain; as well in the measure of punishment, as in the
distribution of mercy.</p>

<p>The severity of the punishment, which at present attaches to crimes
regarded by mankind as of an inferior nature, and which affect
property in a trivial manner, is also deserving the most serious
attention. It is only necessary to be acquainted with the modern
history of the <i>criminal prosecutions, trials, acquittals, and pardons
in this country</i>, in order to be completely convinced that the
progressive increase of delinquents, and the evils experienced by
Society from the multitude of petty crimes, result in a great measure
from this single circumstance.</p>

<p>It will scarcely be credited by those, whose habits of life do not
permit them to enter into discussions of this sort, that by the Laws
of England, there are above <i>one hundred and sixty</i> different offences
which subject the parties who are found guilty, to death without
benefit of Clergy. This multiplicity of capital punishments must, in
the nature of things, defeat those ends, the attainment of which ought
to be the object of all Law, namely, <i>The Prevention of Crimes</i>.</p>

<p>In consequence of this severity, (to use the words of an admired
Writer,) "The injured, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">-6-</a></span> compassion, will often forbear to
prosecute: Juries, through compassion, will sometimes forget their
oaths, and either acquit the guilty or mitigate the nature of the
offence: and Judges, through compassion, will respite one half the
convicts, and recommend them to Royal Mercy."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The Roman Empire never flourished so much as during the æra of the
Portian Law, which abrogated the punishment of death for all offences
whatsoever. When severe punishments and an incorrect Police were
afterwards revived, the Empire fell.</p>

<p>It is not meant, however, to be insinuated that this would be,
altogether, a proper system of Criminal Jurisprudence to be adopted in
modern times.</p>

<p>In the present state of society it becomes indispensably necessary,
that offences, which in their nature are highly injurious to the
Public, and where no mode of prevention can be established, should be
punished by the forfeiture of life; but these dreadful examples should
be exhibited as seldom as possible: for while on the one hand, such
punishments often defeat the ends of Justice, by their not being
carried into execution; so on the other, by being often repeated, they
lose their effect upon the minds of the People.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">-7-</a></span></p>
<p>However much we glory (and we ought to glory) in the general
excellence of our Criminal Law, yet there is no truth more clear and
obvious than this:&mdash;"That this code exhibits too much the appearance
of a heterogeneous mass, concocted too often on the spur of the
occasion (as Lord Bacon expresses it):&mdash;and frequently without that
degree of accuracy which is the result of able and minute discussion,
or a due attention to the revision of the existing laws; or how far
their provisions bear upon new and accumulated statutes introduced
into Parliament; often without either consideration or knowledge, and
without those precautions which are always necessary, when laws are to
be made which may affect the property, the liberty, and perhaps even
the lives of thousands."</p>

<p>Some steps have indeed, been taken in Parliament, since this work
first appeared, towards a general revision of our Statute Law;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
which, it is hoped, will ere long be adopted. Whenever the time shall
arrive that the existing laws, which form the present Criminal Code,
shall be referred to able and intelligent men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">-8-</a></span> effectually to revise,
consolidate, and adjust the whole, in a manner best suited to the
present state of Society and Manners, the investigation will
unquestionably excite no little wonder and astonishment.</p>

<p>Penal laws, which are either obsolete or absurd, or which have arisen
from an adherence to rules of Common Law when the reasons have ceased
upon which these rules are founded; and in short, all Laws which
appear not to be consonant to the dictates of truth and justice, the
feelings of Humanity, and the indelible rights of Mankind should be
abrogated and repealed.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>But the deficiency of the Criminal Code does not arise solely from an
erroneous and undigested scale of penalties and punishments. While on
the one hand, we have to lament the number of these applicable to
certain offences of a slight nature; we have equally to regret, that
there exist crimes of considerable enormity, for the punishment of
which the Law has made no provision.</p>

<p>Among the most prominent of these crimes, may be ranked the receiving
<i>Cash or Specie, Bank-Notes</i> or <i>Bills, knowing them to be stolen</i>.</p>

<p>To this very high offence, in its nature so productive of mischief in
a Commercial Country, no punishment at all attaches; inasmuch as
<i>Specie, Notes and Bills</i>, are not considered for this purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">-9-</a></span> to be
<i>Goods and Chattels</i>; and the law only makes it a crime to receive
property so described.</p>

<p>If therefore a notorious Receiver of stolen goods shall be convicted
of purchasing a glass bottle or a pewter pot, he is liable to be
punished severely; but if he receives ten or twenty thousand pounds in
<i>Cash</i>, <i>Bank Notes</i>, or <i>Bills</i>, he escapes with impunity!<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Innumerable almost are the other instances which could be collected
from Reporters of Criminal Cases, shewing the deficiency of the
Criminal Code; and in how many instances substantial justice is
defeated, and public wrongs are suffered to go unpunished, through the
objections and quibbles constantly raised in Courts of Justice; and
which are allowed to prevail, principally, for want of that revision
of our laws and those amendments which the present state of Society
and Commerce requires.</p>

<p>One of the chief nurseries of Crimes is to be traced to the Receivers
of Stolen Property.</p>

<p>Without that easy encouragement which these Receivers hold out, by
administering immediately to the wants of criminals, and concealing
what they purloin, a Thief, a Robber, or a Burglar, could not in fact,
carry on his trade.</p>

<p>And yet, conclusive and obvious, as this remark must be, it is a
sorrowful truth, that in the Metropolis alone there are at present
supposed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">-10-</a></span> upwards of Three Thousand Receivers of various kinds
of stolen Goods; and an equal proportion all over the Country, who
keep open shop for the purpose of purchasing at an under-price&mdash;often
for a mere trifle,&mdash;every kind of property brought to them; from a
nail, or a glass bottle, up to the most valuable article either new or
old; and this without asking a single question.</p>

<p>It is supposed that the property, purloined and pilfered in a little
way, from almost every family, and from every <i>house, stable, shop,
warehouse, workshop, foundery, and other repository</i>, in and about the
Metropolis, may amount to about £.700,000 in one year, exclusive of
depredations on ships in the River Thames, which, before the
establishment of the Marine Police System in June 1798, were estimated
at half a million more, including the stores and materials!&mdash;When to
this is also added the Pillage of his Majesty's stores, in ships of
war, Dock-yards, and other public repositories, the aggregate will be
found in point of extent, almost to exceed credibility!</p>

<p>It is a melancholy reflection to consider how many individuals, young
and old, who are not of the class or description of common or even
repeated thieves, are implicated in this system of depredation; who
would probably have remained honest and industrious, had it not been
for the easy mode of raising money, which these numerous Receivers of
stolen goods hold out in every bye-street and lane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">-11-</a></span> in the Metropolis:
In their houses, although a beggarly appearance of old iron, old rags,
or second-hand clothes, is only exhibited, the back apartments are
often filled with the most valuable articles of ship-stores,
copper-bolts and nails, brass and other valuable metals, West-India
produce, household goods and wearing apparel; purchased from
artificers, labourers in the docks, lumpers, and others employed on
the River Thames, menial servants, apprentices, journeymen, porters,
chimney-sweepers, itinerant Jews, and others; who, thus encouraged and
protected, go on with impunity, and without the least dread of
detection, from the easiness of access, which their various
employments give them, plundering every article not likely to be
missed, in the houses or stables of men of property; or in the shops,
ware-houses, founderies, or work-shops of manufacturers; or from new
buildings; from ships in the river; nay even from his Majesty's
stores, and other repositories, so that in some instances, the same
articles are said to be sold to the Public Boards three or four times
over.</p>

<p>Thus the moral principle is totally destroyed among a vast body of the
lower ranks of the People; for wherever prodigality, dissipation, or
gaming, whether in the Lottery or otherwise, occasions a want of
money, every opportunity is sought to purloin public or private
property; recourse is then had to all those tricks and devices, by
which even children are enticed to steal before they know that it is a
crime; and to raise money at the pawnbrokers, or the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">-12-</a></span> iron or rag
shops, to supply the unlawful desires of profligate parents.</p>

<p>Hence also, Servants, Apprentices, Journeymen, and in short all
classes of labourers and domestics, are led astray by the temptations
to spend money, which occur in this Metropolis; and by the facility
afforded through the numerous Receivers of stolen Goods, who
administer to their pecuniary wants, on every occasion, when they can
furnish them with any article of their ill-gotten plunder.</p>

<p>The necessity of adopting some effectual regulations respecting the
numerous class of Dealers in old metal, stores, and wearing apparel,
is too obvious to require illustration; and the progressive
accumulation of these pests of Society is proved, by their having
increased, from about 300 to 3000, in the course of the last twenty
years, in the Metropolis alone!</p>

<p>Similar regulations should also be extended to all the more latent
Receivers, who do not keep open shop; but secretly support the
professed Robbers and Burglars, by purchasing their plunder the moment
it is acquired: of which latter class there are some who are said to
be extremely opulent.</p>

<p>It would by no means be difficult to form such a plan of Police as
should establish many useful restrictions, for the purpose of checking
and embarrassing these criminal people; so as to render it extremely
difficult, if not impracticable for them, in many instances, to carry
on their business without the greatest hazard of detection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">-13-</a></span></p>

<p>But laws for this purpose must not be placed upon the Statute-Book as
a kind of dead letter, only to be brought into action when accident
may lead to the detection, perhaps of one in a thousand. If the evil
is to be cured at all, it must be by the promotion and encouragement
of an active principle, under proper superintendance, calculated to
prevent every class of dealers, who are known to live partly or wholly
by fraud, from pursuing those illegal practices; which nothing but a
watchful Police, aided by a correct system of restraints, can possibly
effect.</p>

<p>Nor ought it to be argued, that the restraints, which may hereafter be
proposed, will affect the liberty of the Subject. They will assist and
protect the honest and fair dealer; and it is perfectly consistent
with the spirit of our ancient laws, to restrain persons from doing
evil, who are likely to commit offences; the restrictions can affect
only a very few, comparatively speaking; and those too whose criminal
conduct has been the principal, if not the sole cause, of abridging
the general liberty; while it subjected the great mass of the people
to the risk of their life and property.</p>

<p>Whenever Dealers, of any description, are known to encourage or to
support crimes, or criminal or fraudulent persons, it becomes the
indispensable interest of the State, and the duty of the Legislators
to prevent them from pursuing, at least, the mischievous part of their
trade; and that provisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">-14-</a></span> should be made for carrying the laws
strictly and regularly into execution.</p>

<p>While restraints of a much severer nature than those which are
hereafter proposed, attach to all trades upon which a revenue is
collected; can it be considered as any infringement of freedom, to
extend a milder system to those who not only destroy liberty but
invade property?</p>

<p>The present state of Society and Manners calls aloud for the adoption
of this principle of regulation, as the only practicable means of
preserving the morals of a vast body of the Community; and of
preventing those numerous and increasing crimes and misdemeanors,
which are ultimately attended with as much evil to the perpetrators as
to the sufferers.</p>

<p>If such a principle were once established, under circumstances which
would insure a correct and regular execution; and if, added to this,
certain other practicable arrangements should take place, (which will
be discussed in their regular order in these pages,) we might soon
congratulate ourselves on the immediate and obvious reduction of the
number of Thieves, Robbers, Burglars, and other criminals in this
Metropolis, being no longer able to exist, or to escape detection.
Without the aid, the concealment, and the opportunities, afforded at
present by the multitude of Receivers spread all over the Capital,
they would be compelled to abandon their evil pursuits, as no less
unprofitable and hazardous, than they are destructive to the best
interests of Society.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">-15-</a></span></p>

<p>This indeed is very different from what is said to have once prevailed
in the Capital, when criminals were permitted to proceed from the
first stage of depravity until they were worth forty pounds.&mdash;This is
not the System which subjected the Public to the intermediate
depredations of every villain from his first starting, till he could
be clearly convicted of a capital offence.&mdash;Neither is it the System
which encouraged public houses of rendezvous for Thieves, for the
purpose of knowing where to apprehend them, when they became ripe for
the punishment of death.</p>

<p>The System now suggested, is calculated to prevent, if possible, the
seeds of villainy from being sown; or, if sown, to check their growth
in the bud, and never permit them to ripen at all.</p>

<p>It is proposed to extend this system of prevention to the Coiners,
Dealers, and Utterers of base Money; and to every species of theft,
robbery, fraud, and depredation.</p>

<p>The vast increase, and the extensive circulation of counterfeit Money,
particularly of late years, is too obvious not to have attracted the
notice of all ranks. It has become an enormous evil in the melancholy
catalogue of Crimes which the Laws of the Country are called upon to
assist the Police in suppressing.&mdash;Its extent almost exceeds
credibility; and the dexterity and ingenuity of these counterfeiters
have, (after considerable practice,) enabled them to finish the
different kinds of base Money in so masterly a manner, that it has
become extremely difficult for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">-16-</a></span> the common observer to distinguish
their spurious manufacture from the worn-out Silver of the Mint.&mdash;So
systematic, indeed, has this nefarious traffic become of late, that
the great dealers, who, in most instances are the employers of the
Coiners, execute orders for the Town and Country, with the same
regularity as manufacturers in fair branches of trade.</p>

<p>Scarcely a waggon or coach departs from the Metropolis, which does not
carry boxes and parcels of base Coin to the camps, sea-ports, and
manufacturing towns. In London, regular markets, in various public and
private houses, are held by the principal Dealers; where <i>Hawkers,
Pedlars, fraudulent Horse-Dealers, Unlicensed Lottery-Office-Keepers,
Gamblers at Fairs, Itinerant Jews, Irish Labourers, Servants of
Toll-Gatherers, and Hackney-Coach Owners, fraudulent Publicans,
Market-Women, Rabbit-Sellers, Fish-Cryers, Barrow-Women</i>, and many who
would not be suspected, are regularly supplied with counterfeit Copper
and Silver, with the advantage of nearly £.100 <i>per cent.</i> in their
favour; and thus it happens, that through these various channels, the
country is deluged with immense quantities of base Money, which get
into circulation; while an evident diminution of the Mint Coinage is
apparent to every common observer.</p>

<p>It is impossible to reflect on the necessity to which all persons are
thus reduced, of receiving and again uttering, Money which is known to
be false and counterfeit, without lamenting, that by thus
fami<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">-17-</a></span>liarizing the mind to fraud and deception, the same laxity of
conduct may be introduced into other transactions of life:&mdash;The
barrier being broken down in one part, the principle of common honesty
is infringed upon, and infinite mischief to the very best interests of
Society, is the result, in cases at first unthought of.</p>

<p>To permit, therefore, the existence of an adulterated, and
ill-regulated Silver and Copper Coinage, is in fact to tolerate
general fraud and deception, to the ultimate loss of many individuals;
for the evil must terminate at some period, and then thousands must
suffer; with this aggravation, that the longer it continues the
greater will be the loss of property.</p>

<p>Nor has the mischief been confined to the counterfeiting the Coin of
the Realm. The avarice and ingenuity of man is constantly finding out
new sources of fraud; insomuch, that in London, and in Birmingham, and
its neighbourhood, Louis d'Ors, Half Johannas, French Half Crowns and
Shillings, as well as several coins of Flanders and Germany, and
Dollars of excellent workmanship, in exact imitation of the Spanish
Dollars issued from the Bank, in 1797, have been from time to time
counterfeited apparently without suspicion, that under the act of the
14th of Elizabeth, (cap. 3,) the offenders were guilty of misprision
of High Treason.</p>

<p>These ingenious miscreants have also extended their iniquitous
manufacture to the coins of India; and a Coinage of the Star Pagoda of
Arcot was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">-18-</a></span> established in London for years by one person.&mdash;These
counterfeits, being made wholly of blanched copper, tempered in such a
manner as to exhibit, when stamped, the cracks in the edges, which are
always to be found on the real Pagoda, cost the maker only Three
Half-pence each, after being double gilt.&mdash;When finished, they are
generally sold to Jews at Five Shillings a dozen, who disposed of them
afterwards at 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>s.</i> or even 5<i>s.</i> each; and through this medium,
they have been introduced by a variety of channels into India, where
they were mixed with the real Pagodas of the country, and passed at
their full denominated value of Eight Shillings sterling.</p>

<p>The Sequins of Turkey, another Gold Coin, worth about five or six
shillings, have in like manner been counterfeited in London;&mdash;Thus the
national character is wounded, and the disgrace of the British name
proclaimed in Asia, and even in the most distant regions of India. Nor
can it be sufficiently lamented that persons who consider themselves
as ranking in superior stations of life, with some pretensions to
honour and integrity, have suffered their avarice so far to get the
better of their honesty, as to be concerned in this iniquitous
traffic.</p>

<p>It has been recently discovered that there are at least 120 persons in
the Metropolis and the Country, employed principally in coining and
selling base Money; and this, independent of the numerous horde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">-19-</a></span> of
Utterers, who chiefly support themselves by passing it at its full
value.</p>

<p>It will scarcely be credited, that of Criminals of this latter class
who have either been detected, prosecuted, or convicted, within the
last seven years, there stand upon the Register of the Solicitor to
the Mint, more than 650 names!&mdash;And yet the mischief is not
diminished. When the Reader is informed, that two persons can finish
from £.200 to £.300 (nominal value,) in base silver in <i>six days</i>; and
that three people, within the same period, will stamp the like amount
in Copper, and takes into the calculation the number of known Coiners,
the aggregate amount in the course of a year will be found to be
immense.</p>

<p>The causes of this enormous evil are, however, easily developed.&mdash;The
principal laws relative to Counterfeit Coin having been made a Century
ago, the tricks and devices of modern times are not sufficiently
provided against;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> when it is considered also, that the offence of
dealing in base Money, (which is the main spring of the evil,) is only
punishable by a slight imprisonment; that several offences of a
similar nature are not punishable at all, by any existing statute; and
that the detection of actual Coiners, so as to obtain the proof
necessary for conviction, required by Law, is, in many in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">-20-</a></span>stances,
impracticable; it is not to be wondered at, where the profit is so
immense, with so many chances of escaping punishment, that the coinage
of, and traffic in, counterfeit Money has attracted the attention of
so many unprincipled and avaricious persons.</p>

<p>Having thus stated many prominent abuses which appear to arise from
the imperfections in our Criminal Code, as well as the benefits which
an improved system would extend to the country; it now remains to
elucidate the further evils arising to Society, from the abuses
practised in carrying the existing statutes into execution.&mdash;As the
laws now stand, little or no energy enters into the system of
detection, so as to give vigor and effect to that branch of Police
which relates to the apprehension of persons charged with offences;
and no sooner does a Magistrate commit a hacknied Thief or Receiver of
stolen Goods, a Coiner, or Dealer in base Money, or a Criminal charged
with any other fraud or offence punishable by law, than recourse is
immediately had to some disreputable Attorney, whose mind is made up
and prepared to practise every trick and device which can defeat the
ends of substantial justice. Depraved persons, frequently accomplices,
are hired to swear an <i>alibi</i>; witnesses are cajoled, threatened, or
bribed either to mutilate their evidence, or to speak doubtfully on
the trial, although they swore positively before the committing
Magistrate.</p>

<p>If bribes and persuasions will not do, the prosecu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">-21-</a></span>tors are either
intimidated by the expence,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> or softened down by appeals to their
humanity; and under such circumstances, they neither employ counsel
nor take the necessary steps to bring forward evidence: the result is,
that the Bill is either returned <i>ignoramus</i> by the Grand Jury; or, if
a trial takes place, under all the disadvantages of a deficient
evidence, without a counsel for the prosecution, an advocate is heard
for the prisoner, availing himself of every trifling inaccuracy which
may screen his client from the punishment of the Law, the hardened
villain is acquitted and escapes justice: while, as we before noticed,
the novice in crimes, unskilled in the deficiencies of the Law, and
unable, from the want of criminal connections, or that support which
the professed thief receives from the Buyers of stolen goods, to
procure the aid of counsel to defend him, <i>is often convicted</i>!</p>

<p>The Registers of the Old Bailey afford a lamentable proof of the evils
arising from the present mode of trying criminals without a public
Prosecutor for the Crown.&mdash;In the course of seven years, previous to
the Police Establishment, no less than 4262 prisoners, who had been
actually put upon their trial by the Grand Jury, were let loose upon
the Public by acquittals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">-22-</a></span></p>

<p>Since that period no material diminution has taken place, except what
may be easily accounted for by the war; and when to this dreadful
Catalogue of Human Depravity, is to be added, the vast number of
criminals who are periodically discharged from the different gaols by
proclamation, and of cheats, swindlers, gamblers, and others, who have
never yet been discovered or known, we may state with certainty that
there are at this time <i>many thousand</i> individuals, male and female,
prowling about in this Metropolis, who principally support themselves
by various depredations on the Public.</p>

<p>Nor does the evil rest here; for even convicted felons, in too many
instances, find means to escape without punishment; and to join that
phalanx of villains, who are constantly engaged in objects of
depredation and mischief.</p>

<p>No sooner does the punishment of the law attach on a criminal, than
false humanity becomes his friend. Pardons are applied for; and it is
known that his Majesty's great goodness and love of mercy has been
frequently abused by the tricks, devices, and frauds, too commonly
resorted to, by convicts and agents equally depraved as themselves;
who while they have recourse to every species of falsehood and
forgery, for the purpose of attaining the object in view, at the same
time plunder the friends and relatives of the prisoner, of their last
guinea, as the wages of villainy and misrepresentation.</p>

<p>By such nefarious practices, it is much to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">-23-</a></span> feared, that many a
hardened villain has eluded the punishment of the Law, without any
previous reference to the committing Magistrates, who may be supposed
to have accurately examined into his character and connections; and
what is still worse, without extending to the Community those benefits
which might arise from important discoveries useful to Public Justice;
such as convicted felons are always capable of making, and which, in
conjunction with transportation, it should seem, ought to be one
indispensable condition, upon which pardons should be granted to
capital convicts.</p>

<p>Instead of these precautions which appear to be absolutely requisite,
it is to be lamented, that without reflecting that a common thief can
seldom be restrained by military discipline, many of the worst class
of convicts have received his Majesty's gracious pardon, on the simple
condition of going into the Army or Navy: This has been no sooner
granted, than the Royal Mercy has been abused, either by desertion, or
by obtaining a discharge, in consequence of some real or pretended
incapacity, which was previously concealed. Relieved in so easy a
manner, from the heavy load of a capital punishment, the culprits
return again to their old practices; and by this means, punishment not
only ceases to operate as a prevention of crimes, by example, but
becomes even an encouragement; while the labour of detection, and the
expence of trial and conviction, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">-24-</a></span> fruitlessly thrown on an injured
individual, and their effect is wholly lost to the Public.</p>

<p>In addition to the enormous evil arising from the periodical discharge
of so many criminals by proclamations, acquittals, and pardons; <i>the</i>
<span class="smcap">Hulks</span> also send forth, at stated times, a certain number of convicts;
who having <i>no asylum</i>, <i>no home</i>, <i>no character</i>, and <i>no means of
subsistence</i>, seem to have only the alternative of starving, or
joining their companions in iniquity; thus adding strength to the body
of criminals, by the accession of men, who, polluted and depraved by
every human vice, rendered familiar to their minds in those seminaries
of profligacy and wickedness from whence they have come, employ
themselves constantly in planning and executing acts of violence, and
depredation upon the Public; and some of them, rendered desperate from
an additional degree of depravity, feel no compunction in adding the
crimes of murder to that of robbery, as has been too clearly
manifested by many late instances.</p>

<p>From what has been thus stated, is it not fair to conclude, that the
want of security which the Public experiences with regard to life and
property, and the inefficacy of the Police in preventing crimes, are
to be attributed principally to the following causes?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. <i>The imperfections in the Criminal Code; and in many
instances, its deficiency, with respect to the mode of
punishment; as well as to the want of many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">-25-</a></span>
regulations, provisions, and restraints, applicable to the
present of Society, for the purpose of preventing crimes.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>The want of an active principle, calculated to
concentrate and connect the whole Police of the Metropolis
and the Nation; and to reduce the general management to
system and method, by the interposition of a superintending
agency, composed of able, intelligent, and indefatigable men,
acting under the direction and controul of his Majesty's
Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department.&mdash;On
these persons, it is proposed, should devolve the subordinate
care and direction of the general Police of the Metropolis;
so as to obtain, by the introduction of order and
arrangement, and by efforts of labour and exertion, a
complete History of the connections, and pursuits of all or
most of the criminal and fraudulent persons who resort to the
Metropolis; (either natives or foreigners;) forming, from
such materials, a Register of all known offenders, and
thereby establishing a clue for their detection, as often as
they are charged with committing depredations on the
Public&mdash;with power to reward Officers of Justice, and all
other persons whose services are found to be useful in the
discovery or detection of delinquents of every
description.&mdash;To keep an Account of property stolen, or
procured by swindling or fraudulent transactions in the
Metropolis, as well as in other parts of Great-Britain:&mdash;To
establish a Correspondence with the Magistrates in Town and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">-26-</a></span>
Country, so as to be able more effectually to watch the
motions of all suspected persons; with a view to quick and
immediate detection; and to interpose such embarrassments in
the way of every class of offenders, as may diminish crimes
by increasing the risk of detection: All this, under
circumstances where a</i> centre-point would be formed, <i>and the
general affairs of the Police conducted with method and
regularity:&mdash;where Magistrates would find assistance and
information; where the greater offences, such as the</i> Coinage
of base Money, <i>and</i> Lottery Insurances, <i>would be traced to
their source; the care and disposal of convicts, according to
their different sentences, be minutely attended to; and the
whole System conducted with that intelligence and benefit to
the Country, which must arise from the attention of men of
business being directed solely to these objects, distinct
from all other affairs of State; and their exertions being
confined principally to the preservation of the morals of the
People, and the prevention of crimes.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>The want of an Institution of Police Magistrates in the
Dock Yards, and in all great Commercial and Manufacturing
Towns, where there are no Corporations or Funds for the
administration of Public Justice.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>The want of a Public Prosecutor for the Crown, in all
criminal cases, for the purpose of preventing fraud, delay
and expence in the administration of Justice.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">-27-</a></span></p>

<p>5. <i>The want of a more correct and regular System, for the
purpose of obtaining the fullest and most authentic
information, to avoid deceptions in the obtaining of
pardons.</i></p>

<p>6. <i>The deficiency of the System of the</i> Hulks.</p>

<p>7. <i>The want of an improved System with regard to the
arrangements and disposal of Convicts&mdash;destined for hard
labour or for transportation.</i></p>

<p>8. <i>The want of national</i> Penitentiary Houses, <i>for the
punishment and reformation of certain classes of Convicts.</i></p>

<p>9. <i>The want of a more solemn mode of conducting Executions;
whenever such dreadful examples are necessary for the
furtherance of Public Justice.</i></p></div>

<p>Having thus explained the general features of the actually existing
<i>Crimes</i>, and their probable causes, we shall in the next place
proceed to some considerations on the present principles of
<i>Punishment</i> in this Country, as compared with those in other Nations
and ages. It will then be requisite to enter into particular and
minute details on both these subjects; and to offer some suggestions
for the introduction of new and applicable laws to be administered
with purity under a correct and energetic System of Police; which may
be, in some degree, effectual in guarding the Public against those
increasing and multifarious injuries and dangers, which are
universally felt and lamented.</p>

<hr class="dbl1" />
<hr class="dbl2" />

<p><span class="cap">P</span>UNISHMENT, (says a learned and respectable author) <i>is an evil which
a delinquent suffers, unwillingly, by the order of a Judge or
Magistrate; on account of some act done which the Law prohibits, or
something omitted which the Law enjoins.</i></p>

<p>All Punishment should be proportioned to the nature of the offence
committed; and the Legislature, in adjusting Punishment with a view to
the public good, ought, according to the dictates of sound reason, to
act on a comparison of the Crime under consideration, with other
offences injurious to Society: and thus by comparing one offence with
an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">-30-</a></span>other, to form a scale, or gradation, of Punishments, as nearly as
possible consistent with the strict rules of distributive justice.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>It is the triumph of Liberty, says the great Montesquieu, when the
criminal laws proportion punishments to the particular nature of each
offence.&mdash;It may be further added, that when this is the case, it is
also the triumph of Reason.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain in what degree the Public is injured or
endangered by any crime, it is necessary to weigh well and
dispassionately the nature of the offence, as it affects the
Community.&mdash;It is through this medium, that Treason and Rebellion are
discovered to be higher and more dangerous offences than breaches of
the peace by riotous assemblies; as such riotous meetings are in like
manner considered as more criminal than a private assault.</p>

<p>In punishing delinquents, two objects ought to be invariably kept in
view.&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. The Amendment of the Delinquent.</p>

<p>2. The Example afforded to others.</p>
</div>

<p><i>To which may be added, in certain cases</i>,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>3. Retribution to the party injured.</p>
</div>

<p>If we attend to Reason, the <i>Mistress of all Law</i>, she will convince
us that it is both unjust and injurious to Society to inflict Death,
except for the highest offences, and in cases where the offender
appears to be incorrigible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">-31-</a></span></p>

<p>Wherever the amendment of a delinquent is in view, it is clear that
his punishment cannot extend to death: If expiating an offence by the
loss of life is to be (as it certainly is at present) justified by the
necessity of making examples for the purpose of preventing crimes, it
is evident that the present System has not had that effect, since they
are by no means diminished; and since even the dread of this
Punishment, has, under present circumstances, so little effect upon
guilty associates, that it is no uncommon thing for these hardened
offenders to be engaged in new acts of theft, at the very moment their
companions in iniquity are launching in their very presence into
eternity.</p>

<p>The minds of offenders, long inured to the practice of criminal
pursuits, are by no means beneficially affected by the punishment of
Death, which they are taught to consider as nothing but a momentary
paroxysm which ends all their distress at once; nay even as a relief,
which many of them, grown desperate, look upon with a species of
indifference, bordering on a desire to meet that fate, which puts an
end to the various distresses and anxieties attendant on a life of
criminality.</p>

<p>The effect of capital punishments, in the manner they are now
conducted, therefore, as relates to example, appears to be much less
than has been generally imagined.</p>

<p>Examples would probably have much greater force, even on those who at
present appear dead to shame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">-32-</a></span> and the stigma of infamy, were convicts
exhibited day after day, to their companions, occupied in mean and
servile employments in Penitentiary Houses, or on the highways,
canals, mines, or public works.&mdash;It is in this way only that there is
the least chance of making retribution to the parties whom they have
injured; or of reimbursing the State, for the unavoidable expence
which their evil pursuits have occasioned.</p>

<p>Towards accomplishing the desirable object of perfection in a criminal
code, every wise Legislature will have it in contemplation rather to
prevent than to punish crimes; that in the chastisement given, the
delinquent may be restored to Society as an useful member.</p>

<p>This purpose may possibly be best effected by the adoption of the
following general rules.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. That the Statute-Laws should accurately explain the
enormity of the offence forbidden: and that its provisions
should be clear and explicit, resulting from a perfect
knowledge of the subject; so that, justice may not be
defeated in the execution.</p>

<p>2. That the Punishments should be proportioned and adapted,
as nearly as possible, to the different degrees of offences;
with a proper attention also to the various shades of
enormity which may attach to certain crimes.</p>

<p>3. That persons prosecuting, or compelled so to do, should
not only be indemnified from expence; but also that
reparation should be made, for losses sustained by the
injured party, in all cases where it can be obtained from
the labour, or property of the delinquent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">-33-</a></span></p>

<p>4. That satisfaction should be made to the State for the
injury done to the Community; by disturbing the peace, and
violating the purity of Society.</p></div>

<p>Political laws, which are repugnant to the Law of nature and reason,
ought not to be adopted. The objects above-mentioned seem to include
all that can be necessary for the attention of Law-givers.</p>

<p>If on examination of the frame and tendency of our criminal Laws, both
with respect to the principles of reason and State Policy, the Author
might be allowed to indulge a hope, that what he brings under the
Public Eye on this important subject, would be of use in promoting the
good of Mankind, he should consider his labours as very amply
rewarded.</p>

<p>The severity of the criminal Laws is not only an object of horror, but
the disproportion of the punishments, as will be shewn in the course
of this Work, breathes too much the spirit of <span class="smcap">Draco</span>,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> who boasted
<i>that he punished all crimes with death; because small crimes deserved
it, and he could find no higher punishment for the greatest</i>.</p>

<p>Though the ruling principle of our Government is unquestionably,
<i>Liberty</i>, it is much to be feared that the rigour which the Laws
indiscriminately inflict on slight as well as more atrocious offences,
can be ill reconciled to the true distinctions of Morality, and strict
notions of Justice, which form the peculiar ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">-34-</a></span>cellence of those
States which are to be characterised as free.</p>

<p>By punishing smaller offences with extraordinary severity, is there
not a risque of inuring men to baseness; and of plunging them into the
sink of infamy and despair, from whence they seldom fail to rise
capital criminals; often to the destruction of their fellow-creatures,
and always to their own inevitable perdition?</p>

<p>To suffer the lower orders of the people to be ill educated&mdash;to be
totally inattentive to those wise regulations of State Policy which
might serve to guard and improve their morals; and then to punish them
for crimes which have originated in bad habits, has the appearance of
a cruelty not less severe than any which is exercised under the most
despotic Governments.</p>

<p>There are two Circumstances which ought also to be minutely considered
in apportioning the measure of Punishment&mdash;<i>the immorality of the
action; and its evil tendency</i>.</p>

<p>Nothing contributes in a greater degree to deprave the minds of the
people, than the little regard which Laws pay to Morality; by
inflicting more severe punishments on offenders who commit, what may
be termed, <i>Political Crimes</i>, and crimes against property, than on
those who violate religion and virtue.</p>

<p>When we are taught, for instance, by the measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">-35-</a></span> of punishment that
it is considered by the Law as a greater crime to coin a sixpence than
to kill our father or mother, nature and reason revolt against the
proposition.</p>

<p>In offences which are considered by the Legislature as merely
personal, and not in the class of public wrongs, the disproportionate
punishment is extremely shocking.</p>

<p>If, for example, a personal assault is committed of the most cruel,
aggravated, and violent nature, the offender is seldom punished in any
other manner than by fine and imprisonment: but if a delinquent steals
from his neighbour secretly more than the value of twelve-pence, the
Law dooms him to death. And he can suffer no greater punishment
(except the ignominy exercised on his dead body,) if he robs and
murders a whole family. Some private wrongs of a flagrant nature are
even passed over with impunity: the seduction of a married woman&mdash;the
destruction of the peace and happiness of families, resulting from
alienating a wife's affections, and defiling her person, is not an
offence punishable by the Criminal Law; while it is death to rob the
person, who has suffered this extensive injury, of a trifle exceeding
a shilling.</p>

<p>The Crime of Adultery was punished with great severity both by the
Grecian and the Roman Laws.&mdash;In England this offence is not to be
found in the Criminal Code.&mdash;It may indeed be punished with fine and
penance by the Spiritual Law; or indirectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">-36-</a></span> in the Courts of Common
Law, by an action for damages, at the suit of the party injured. The
former may now (perhaps fortunately) be considered as a dead letter;
while the other remedy, being merely of a pecuniary nature, has little
effect in restraining this species of delinquency.</p>

<p>Like unskilful artists, we seem to have begun at the wrong end; since
it is clear that the distinction, which has been made in the
punishments between public and private crimes, is subversive of the
very foundation it would establish.</p>

<p>Private Offences being the source of public crimes, the best method of
guarding Society against the latter is, to make proper provisions for
checking the former.&mdash;A man of pure morals always makes the best
Subject of every State; and few have suffered punishment as public
delinquents, who have not long remained unpunished as private
offenders. The only means, therefore, of securing the peace of
Society, and of preventing more atrocious crimes, is, to enforce by
lesser punishments, the observance of religious and moral duties:
Without this, Laws are but weak Guardians either of the State, or the
persons or property of the Subject.</p>

<p>The People are to the Legislature what a child is to a parent:&mdash;As the
first care of the latter is to teach the love of virtue, and a dread
of punishment; so ought it to be the duty of the former, to frame Laws
with an immediate view to the general improvement of morals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">-37-</a></span></p>

<p>"That Kingdom is happiest where there is most virtue," says an elegant
writer.&mdash;It follows, of course, that those Laws are the best which are
most calculated to promote Religion and Morality; the operation of
which in every State, is to produce a conduct intentionally directed
towards the Public Good.</p>

<p>It seems that by punishing what are called public Crimes, with
peculiar severity, we only provide against present and temporary
mischiefs. That we direct the vengeance of the Law against effects,
which might have been prevented by obviating their causes:&mdash;And this
may be assigned in part as the cause of Civil Wars and
Revolutions.&mdash;The Laws are armed against the <i>powers</i> of Rebellion,
but are not calculated to oppose its <i>principle</i>.</p>

<p>Few civil wars have been waged from considerations of Public Virtue,
or even for the security of Public Liberty. These desperate
undertakings are generally promoted and carried on by abandoned
characters, who seek to better their fortunes in the general havoc and
devastation of their country.&mdash;Those men are easily seduced from their
Loyalty who are apostates from private virtue.</p>

<p>To be secure therefore against those public calamities which, almost
inevitably, lead to anarchy and confusion, it is far better to improve
and confirm a nation in the true principles of natural justice, than
to perplex them by political refinements.</p>

<p>Having thus taken a general view of the principles applicable to
Punishments in general, it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">-38-</a></span> necessary, for the purpose of more
fully illustrating these reflections, briefly to consider the various
leading Offences, and their corresponding Punishments according to the
present state of our Criminal Law; and to examine how far they are
proportioned to each other.</p>

<p>High Treason is the highest civil Crime which can be committed by any
member of the Community.&mdash;After various alterations and amendments
made and repealed in subsequent reigns, the definition of this offence
was settled as it originally stood, by the Act of the 25th of Edward
III. stat. 5, cap. 2. and may be divided into seven different heads:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Compassing or imagining the Death of the King, Queen, or
Heir Apparent.</p>

<p>2. Levying War against the King, in his realm.</p>

<p>3. Adhering to the King's enemies, and giving them aid, in
the realm or elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">-39-</a></span></p>

<p>4. Slaying the King's Chancellor or Judge in the execution
of their offices.</p>

<p>5. Violating the Queen, the eldest daughter of the King, or
the wife of the Heir Apparent, or eldest Son.</p>

<p>6. Counterfeiting the King's Great Seal, or Privy Seal.</p>

<p>7. Counterfeiting the King's Money, or bringing false Money
into the kingdom.</p></div>

<p>This detail shews how much the dignity and security of the King's
person is confounded with that of his officers, and even with his
effigies imprest on his Coin.&mdash;To assassinate the servant, or to
counterfeit the type, is held as criminal as to destroy the Sovereign.</p>

<p>This indiscriminate blending of crimes, so different and
disproportionate in their nature, under one common head, is certainly
liable to great objections; seeing that the judgment in this offence
is so extremely severe and terrible, <i>viz. That the offender be drawn
to the gallows on the ground or pavement: That he be hanged by the
neck, and then cut down alive: That his entrails be taken out and
burned while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">-40-</a></span> he is yet alive: That his head be cut off: That his body
be divided into four parts: And that his head and quarters be at the
King's disposal</i>.&mdash;Women, however, are only to be drawn and
hanged:&mdash;though in all cases of treason, they were heretofore
sentenced to be burned: a cruel punishment, which, after being
alleviated by the custom of previous strangulation, was at length
repealed, by the Act 30 Geo. III. <i>c.</i> 48.</p>

<p>There are indeed some shades of difference with regard to coining
money; where the offender is only drawn and hanged; and that part of
the punishment which relates to being <i>drawn</i> and <i>quartered</i> is, to
the honour of humanity, never practised. But even in cases of the most
atrocious criminality, the execution of so horrid a sentence seems to
answer no good political purpose.&mdash;Nature shudders at the thought of
imbruing our hands in blood, and mangling the smoaking entrails of our
fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>In most Countries and in all ages, however, Treason has been punished
capitally.&mdash;Under the Roman Laws, by the <i>Cornelia Lex</i>, of which
Sylla, the Dictator, was the author, this Offence was created.&mdash;It was
also made a capital Crime when the Persian Monarchy became despotic.</p>

<p>By the Laws of China, Treason and Rebellion are punished with a rigour
even beyond the severity of our judgment, for the criminals are
ordained to be cut in <i>ten thousand</i> pieces.</p>

<p>There is another species of Treason, called <i>Petty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">-41-</a></span> Treason</i>,
described by the Statute of the 25th of Edward the III. to be the
offence of <i>a Servant killing his Master, a Wife killing her Husband</i>,
or a <i>Secular or Religious slaying his Prelate</i>.&mdash;The Punishment is
somewhat more ignominious than in other capital offences, inasmuch as
a <i>hurdle</i> is used instead of a <i>cart</i>.&mdash;Here again occurs a very
strong instance of the inequality of Punishments; for although the
principle and essence of this Crime is breach of duty and obedience
due to a superior slain, yet if a child murder his parents (unless he
serve them for wages) he is not within the Statute; although it must
seem evident to the meanest understanding that Parricide is certainly
a more atrocious and aggravated offence, than either of those
specified in the Statute.</p>

<p>By the <i>Lex Pompeia</i> of the Romans, Parricides were ordained to be
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: sewn">sown</span> in a sack with a <i>dog</i>, a <i>cock</i>, a
<i>viper</i>, and an <i>ape</i>, and thrown into the sea, thus to perish by the
most cruel of all tortures.</p>

<p>The ancient Laws of all civilized nations punished the crime of
Parricide by examples of the utmost severity.&mdash;The Egyptians put the
delinquents to death by the most cruel of all tortures&mdash;mangling the
body and limbs, and afterwards laying it upon thorns to be burnt
alive.</p>

<p>By the Jewish Law it was death for children to curse, or strike their
parents; and in China, this crime was considered as next in atrocity
to Treason and Rebellion, and in like manner punished by cutting the
delinquent in <i>one thousand</i> pieces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">-42-</a></span></p>

<p>The Laws of England however make no distinction between this crime and
common Murder; while it is to be lamented that offences far less
heinous, either morally or politically considered, are punished with
the same degree of severity; and it is much to be feared, that this
singular inequality is ill calculated to inspire that filial awe and
reverence, to parents, which all human Laws ought to inculcate.</p>

<p>The offences next in enormity to Treason, are by the Laws of England,
denominated Felonies, and these may be considered as of two kinds,
<i>public</i> and <i>private</i>.</p>

<p>Under the head of <i>Public Felonies</i> we shall class the following:
having peculiar relation to the State.</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Felonies relative to the Coin of the Realm.</li>
<li>2. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to the King and his Counsellors, &amp;c.</li>
<li>3. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to Soldiers and Marines.</li>
<li>4. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; to embezzling Public Property.</li>

<p>Those Crimes which we have denominated <i>Public Felonies</i> being merely
of a political nature, it would seem that the ends of justice would be
far better answered, than at present, and convictions oftener
obtained, by different degrees of Punishment short of Death.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>Private Felonies</i>, it may be necessary to make some
specific observations&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The first, in point of enormity, is <i>Murder</i>, which may be committed
in two Ways:&mdash;first, upon <i>one's self</i>, in which case the offender is
denominated <i>Felo de se</i> or a <i>Self-murderer</i>;&mdash;secondly, by killing
another person.</p>

<p>The Athenian Law ordained, that persons guilty of Self-murder should
have the hand cut off which did the murder, and buried in a place
separate from the body; but this seems of little consequence.&mdash;When
such a calamity happens, it is a deplorable misfortune; and there
seems to be a great cruelty in adding to the distress of the wife,
children, or nearest kin of the deceased, by the forfeiture of his
whole property; which is at present confiscated by Law.</p>

<p>By the Law of England, the judgment in case of Murder is, that the
person convicted shall suffer death and that his body shall be
dissected.</p>

<p>The Laws of most civilized nations, both ancient and modern, have
justly punished this atrocious offence with death. It was so by the
Laws of Athens, and also by the Jewish and Roman Laws.&mdash;By the Persian
Law Murderers were pressed to death be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">-44-</a></span>tween two stones; and in China,
persons guilty of this offence are beheaded, except where a person
kills his adversary in a duel, in which case he is
strangled.&mdash;Decapitation, by the Laws of China, is considered the most
dishonourable mode of execution.</p>

<p>In the ruder ages of the world, and before the manners of mankind were
softened by the arts of peace and civilization, Murder was not a
capital crime: Hence it is that the barbarous nations which over-ran
the Western Empire, either expiated this crime by private revenge, or
by a pecuniary composition.&mdash;Our Saxon ancestors punished this high
offence with a fine; and they too countenanced the exercise of that
horrid principle of revenge, by which they added blood to blood.&mdash;But
in the progress of civilization and Society, the nature of this crime
became better understood; private revenge was submitted to the power
of the Law; and the good King Alfred first made Murder a capital
offence in England.</p>

<p>In this case, as in that of Self-murder, the property of the murderer
goes to the State; without any regard to the unhappy circumstances of
the families either of the murdered or the guilty person, who may be
completely ruined by this fatal accident.&mdash;A provision which seems not
well to accord with either the justice or mildness of our Laws.</p>

<p>Man-slaughter is defined to be <i>The killing another without malice,
either express or implied: which may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">-45-</a></span> be either, voluntarily, upon a
sudden heat; or involuntarily, but in the commission of some unlawful
Act</i>. And the Punishment is, <i>that the person convicted shall be burnt
in the hand, and his goods forfeited</i>.&mdash;And offenders are usually
detained in prison for a time not exceeding one year, under the
Statutes regulating the Benefit of Clergy.</p>

<p>Homicide by <i>Misadventure</i> is, when <i>one is doing a lawful act,
without intent to hurt another</i>, and <i>death ensues</i>.&mdash;For this offence
a pardon is allowed of course; but in strictness of Law the property
of the person convicted is forfeited; the rigour of which, however, is
obviated by a Writ of Restitution of his goods, to which the party is
now, by long usage, entitled of right; only paying for suing out the
same.</p>

<p>Homicide <i>by necessity</i> or in <i>Self-defence</i>, is another shade of
Murder, upon which no punishment is inflicted: and in this is included
what the Law expresses by the word <i>Chance-medley</i>: which is properly
applied to such killing as happens in self-defence upon a sudden
rencounter. Yet, still by strictness of Law, the goods and chattels of
the person charged and convicted are forfeited to the Crown; contrary,
as it seems to many, to the principles of Reason and Justice.</p>

<p>It should be recollected that in all cases where the Homicide does not
amount to Murder or Man-slaughter, the Judges permit, nay even direct,
a verdict of acquittal.&mdash;But it appears more consonant with the sound
principles of Justice, that the Law it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">-46-</a></span>self should be precise, than
that the property of a man should, in cases of <i>Misadventure</i>,
<i>Chance-medley</i>, and <i>Self-defence</i> depend upon the construction of a
Judge, or the lenity of a Jury: Some alteration therefore, in the
existing Laws, seems called for in this particular.</p>

<p>Having thus briefly discussed what has occurred relative to the
punishment of offences against life, we come next to make some
observations on what we have denominated <i>Private Felonies against the
Body of the Subject</i>.</p>

<p>By the Grecian, Roman, and Jewish Laws, the abominable crime of
<i>Sodomy</i> was punished with death.&mdash;In France, under the Monarchy, the
offenders suffered death by burning.</p>

<p>The Lombards were said to have brought this detestable vice into
England, in the reign of Edward the Third.&mdash;In ancient times the men
were hanged, and the women drowned: At length by the Act 25th of Henry
the Eighth, cap. 6, it was made Felony without Benefit of Clergy.&mdash;</p>

<p>It has been doubted, however, whether the severity of the punishment
of a crime so unnatural, as even to appear incredible, does not defeat
the object of destroying it, by rendering it difficult to convict an
offender.</p>

<p>The same objection has been made with respect to the crime of
committing <i>a Rape</i>. A proper tenderness for life makes the Law
require a strong evidence, and of course the proof is nice and
difficult;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">-47-</a></span> whereas, were the punishment more mild, it might be more
efficacious in preventing the violation of chastity.</p>

<p>By the Law of Egypt, Rapes were punished by cutting off the offending
parts;&mdash;The Athenian Laws compelled the ravisher of a virgin to marry
her. It was long before this offence was punished capitally by the
Roman Law: but at length the <i>Lex Julia</i> inflicted the pains of death
on the Ravisher.&mdash;The Jewish Law also punished this crime with death;
but if a virgin was deflowered without force, the offender was obliged
to pay a fine, and marry the woman.</p>

<p>By the 18th of Elizabeth, cap. 7, this offence was made Felony without
Benefit of Clergy.</p>

<p>It is certainly of a very heinous nature, and, if tolerated, would be
subversive of all order and morality; yet it may still be questioned,
how far it is either useful or politic to punish it with death; and is
worth considering, whether, well knowing that it originates in the
irregular and inordinate gratification of unruly appetite, the injury
to Society may not be repaired without destroying the offender.</p>

<p>In most cases, this injury might be repaired by compelling (where it
could be done with propriety,) the criminal to marry the injured
party; and it would be well for Society, if the same rule extended not
only to all forcible violations of chastity, but even to instances of
premeditated and systematic Seduction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">-48-</a></span></p>

<p>In cases, however, where marriage could not take place, on account of
legal disability, or refusal on the part of the woman, the criminal
ought to be severely punished, by pecuniary damages to the party
injured, and by hard labour and confinement, or transportation for
life.</p>

<p>The offence considered as next in point of enormity to Rape, is
<i>Forcible Marriage</i>, or <i>Defilement of Women</i>: but it is somewhat
remarkable, that by confining the punishment to offences against women
of estate only, the moral principles are made to yield to political
considerations; and the security of property in this instance, is
deemed more essential, than the preservation of female chastity.</p>

<p>In short, the property of the woman is the measure of the crime; the
statutes of the 3d of Henry the Seventh, cap. 2. and the 39th of
Elizabeth, cap. 9, making it Felony without Benefit of Clergy, to take
away, <i>for lucre</i>, any woman having lands or goods, or being an heir
apparent to an estate, by force, or against her will, and to marry or
to defile her. The forcible marriage and defilement of a woman without
an estate is not punished at all; although, according to every
principle of morality and reason, it is as criminal as the other. It
is indeed an offence not so likely to be committed.</p>

<p>However, it seems in every point of view, impolitic to punish such
offences with death; it might be enough, to expiate the crime by
alienating the estate from the husband&mdash;vesting it in the wife alone,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">-49-</a></span> confining him to hard labour; or by punishing the delinquent, in
very atrocious cases, by transportation.</p>

<p>Polygamy stands next as an offence against the person:&mdash;It was first
declared Felony by the statute of James the first, cap. 11, but not
excluded from the Benefit of Clergy, and therefore not subject to the
punishment of death.</p>

<p>Though, in one view, the having a plurality of wives or husbands,
appears only a political offence, yet it is undeniably a breach of
religious and moral virtue, in a very high degree.&mdash;It is true,
indeed, that in the early ages of the world, Polygamy was tolerated
both in Greece and Rome, even after the People had arrived at a high
pitch of refinement.&mdash;But since the institution of Matrimony under the
present form, Polygamy must be considered as highly criminal, since
marriage is an engagement which cannot be violated without the
greatest injury to Society. The Public Interest, therefore, requires
that it should be punished; and the Act 35th George III. cap. 67,
which punishes this offence with transportation, is certainly not too
severe.</p>

<p>Mayhem, or Maiming, is the last in the Catalogue of <i>Offences against
the Person</i>. It was first made Single Felony by the 5th of Henry the
Fourth, cap. 5.&mdash;It is defined to be <i>maiming, cutting the tongue, or
putting out the eyes of any of the King's liege people</i>. The statute
of the 22d and 23d of Charles the Second, cap. 1. extends the
description of this offence to slitting the nose, cutting off a nose
or lip,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">-50-</a></span> or cutting off or disabling any limb or member, by malice
forethought, and by lying in wait with an intention to maim and
disfigure:&mdash;And this statute made the offence Felony, without Benefit
of Clergy.</p>

<p>To prove malice in this crime, it is sufficient that the act was
voluntary, and of set purpose, though done on a sudden.</p>

<p>Mayhem, as explained in the above statutes, is certainly a very
atrocious offence; and as the punishment is not followed by corruption
of blood, or the forfeiture of the property of the offender, it is,
according to the present system, perhaps not too severe.</p>

<p>One particular sort of Mayhem by cutting off the <i>ear</i>, is punishable
by an Act 37 Hen. VIII. cap. 6. which directs that the offender shall
forfeit treble damages to the party grieved, to be recovered by action
of trespass; and £.10 by way of fine to the King.</p>

<p>We next come to examine <i>Private Felonies</i> against the <i>Goods or
Property of the Individual</i>, viz. <i>Simple Larceny</i>, <i>Mixt Larceny</i>,
and <i>Piracy</i>.</p>

<p>Simple Larceny is divided into two sorts;&mdash;1st, Grand Larceny, and 2d,
Petit Larceny.&mdash;The first is defined to be <i>the felonious taking and
carrying away the mere personal property or goods of another, above
the value of twelve pence</i>.&mdash;This offence is capital, and punished
with death, and the forfeiture of property.</p>

<p>Petit Larceny is where the goods, taken in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">-51-</a></span> above manner, are
under the value of twelve pence; in which case, the punishment
(according to the circumstances of atrocity attending the offence,) is
imprisonment, whipping, or transportation, with forfeiture of goods
and chattels.</p>

<p>Thus it appears, that by the rigour of the Law, stealing the least
trifle above 12<i>d.</i> subjects the offender to the loss of life; a
punishment apparently repugnant to reason, policy, or justice: more
especially when it is considered, that at the time this <i>Anglo Saxon
Law</i> was made, in the reign of <i>Athelstan</i>, 860 years ago, <i>one
shilling</i> was of more value, according to the price of labour, than
<i>seventy-five shillings</i> are at the present period: the life of man
therefore may be justly said to be seventy-five times cheaper than it
was when this mode of punishment was first established.</p>

<p>By the Athenian Laws, the crime of Theft was punished, by paying
double the value of what was stolen, to the party robbed; and as much
more to the public.&mdash;Solon introduced a law, enjoining every person to
state in writing, by what means he gained his livelihood; and if false
information was given, or he gained his living in an unlawful way, he
was punished with death.&mdash;A similar law prevailed among the Egyptians.</p>

<p>The <i>Lex Julia</i> of the Romans made Theft punishable at discretion; and
it was forbidden, that any person should suffer death, or even the
loss of a member, for this crime.&mdash;The greatest punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">-52-</a></span> which
appears to have been inflicted for this offence, in its most
aggravated circumstances, was four-fold restitution.</p>

<p>By the Jewish Law, Theft was punished in the same manner: with the
addition of a fine according to the nature of the offence; excepting
in cases where <i>men</i> were stolen, which was punished with death.</p>

<p>In China, Theft is punished by the bastinadoe, excepting in cases of a
very atrocious nature, and then the culprit is condemned to the
knoutage&mdash;a contrivance not unlike the pillory in this country.</p>

<p>The ancient Laws of this kingdom punished the crime of Theft
differently.&mdash;Our Saxon ancestors did not at first punish it
capitally.&mdash;The Laws of King Ina<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> inflicted the punishment of
death, but allowed the thief to redeem his life, <i>Capitis
estimatione</i>, which was sixty shillings; but in case of an old
offender, who had been often accused, the hand or foot was to be cut
off.</p>

<p>After various changes which took place under different Princes, in the
rude and early periods of our history, it was at length settled in the
9th of Henry the First, (A.D. 1108,) <i>that for theft and robbery,
offenders should be hanged</i>; this has continued to be the law of the
land ever since, excepting in the county palatine of Chester; where
the ancient custom of beheading felons was practised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">-53-</a></span> some time after
the Law of Henry the First; and the Justices of the Peace of that
county, received one shilling from the King, for every head that was
cut off.</p>

<p>Montesquieu seems to be of opinion that as thieves are generally
unable to make restitution, it may be just to make theft a capital
crime.&mdash;But would not the offence be atoned for in a more rational
manner, by compelling the delinquent to labour, first for the benefit
of the party aggrieved, till recompence is made, and then for the
State?<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>According to the present system the offender loses his life, and they
whom he has injured lose their property; while the State also suffers
in being deprived of a member, whose labour, under proper controul,
might have been made useful and productive.</p>

<p>Observations have already been made on one consequence of the severity
of the punishment for this offence; that persons of tender feelings
conscientiously scruple to prosecute delinquents for inconsiderable
Thefts. From this circumstance it is believed, that not one
depredation in a hundred, of those actually committed, comes to the
knowledge of Magistrates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">-54-</a></span></p>

<p>Mixed or <i>compound Larceny</i> has a greater degree of guilt in it than
simple Larceny; and may be committed either by taking from a man, or
from his house. If a person is previously put in fear or assaulted,
the crime is denominated <i>Robbery</i>.</p>

<p>When a Larceny is committed which does not put the party robbed in
fear; it is done privately and without his knowledge, by picking his
pocket, or cutting the purse, and stealing from thence above the value
of twelve pence; or publicly, with the knowledge of the party, by
stealing a hat or wig, and running away.</p>

<p>With respect to <i>Dwelling Houses</i> the Common Law has been altered by
various acts of Parliament; the multiplicity of which is apt to create
confusion; but upon comparing them diligently, we may collect that the
following domestic aggravations of Larceny are punishable with death,
without Benefit of Clergy.</p>

<p>First, <i>Larcenies above the value of twelve pence</i>; committed&mdash;1st. In
a church or chapel, with or without violence or breaking the same; 23
Henry VIII. cap. 1: 1 Edward VI. cap. 12.&mdash;2d. In a booth or tent, in
a market or fair, in the day time or in the night, by violence or
breaking the same; the owner or some of his family, being therein; 5
and 6 Edward VI. cap. 9.&mdash;3d. By robbing a dwelling house in the day
time, (which <i>robbing</i> implies a <i>breaking</i>,) any person being
therein: 3 and 4 William and Mary, cap. 9.&mdash;4th. By the same Act, (and
see the Act 23 Henry VIII. cap. 1.) in a dwelling house, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">-55-</a></span> day or by
night; without breaking the same, any person being therein, and put in
fear: which amounts in law to a Robbery; and in both these last cases
the <i>Accessary before the fact</i> is also excluded from the benefit of
Clergy.</p>

<p>Secondly; <i>Larcenies to the value of five shillings</i>; committed&mdash;1st.
By breaking any dwelling house, or any outhouse, shop, or warehouse
thereunto belonging, in the day time; although no person be therein,
which also now extends to aiders, abettors, and accessaries before the
fact: 39 Elizabeth, cap. 15; see also 3 and 4 William and Mary, cap.
9.&mdash;2d. By privately stealing goods, wares, or merchandise in any
shop, warehouse, coach-houses, or stable, by day or night: though the
same be not broken open, and though no person be therein: which
likewise extends to such as assist, hire, or command the offence to be
committed: 10 and 11 William III. cap. 23.</p>

<p>Lastly; <i>Larcenies to the value of forty shillings</i> from a dwelling
house, or its outhouses, although the same be not broken, and whether
any person be therein or not; unless committed against their masters,
by apprentices, under age of fifteen; 12 Anne, stat. 1. cap. 7.</p>

<p>Piracy is felony against the goods of the Subject by a robbery
committed at sea.&mdash;It is a capital offence by the civil law, although
by Act of Parliament, it may be heard and determined, according to the
rules of the common law, as if the offence had been committed on land.
The mode of trial is regulated by the 28th of Henry VIII. cap. 15; and
further by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">-56-</a></span> Acts 11 and 12 William III. cap. 7. and 39 George III.
cap. 37; which also extend to other offences committed on the High
Seas.</p>

<p>Felonies <i>against the Dwelling or Habitation of a man are of two
kinds; and are denounced</i> Arson <i>and</i> Burglary.</p>

<p><i>Arson</i> or <i>Arsonry</i> is a very atrocious offence&mdash;it is defined to be
<i>the malicious burning of the House of another either by night or by
day</i>. It is in this case a capital offence; but if a man burns his own
house, without injuring any other, it is only a misdemeanor,
punishable by fine, imprisonment, or the pillory.</p>

<p>By the 23d of Henry the Eighth, cap. 1. the capital part of the
offence is extended to persons, (whether principals or accessaries,)
burning dwelling houses; or barns wherein corn is deposited; and by
the 43d of Elizabeth, cap. 13, burning barns or stacks of corn in the
four northern counties, is also made Felony without Benefit of Clergy.</p>

<p>By the 22d and 23d of Car. II. cap. 7, it is made felony to set fire
to any stack of corn, hay, or grain; or other outbuildings, or kilns,
maliciously in the night time; punished with transportation for seven
years.</p>

<p>By the 1st George I. cap. 48, it is also made single felony to set
fire to any wood, underwood, or coppice.</p>

<p>Other burnings are made punishable with death, without Benefit of
Clergy; <i>viz.</i> Setting fire to any house, barn, or outhouse, or to any
hovel, cock, mow, or stack of corn, straw, hay, or wood: or the
rescuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">-57-</a></span> any such offender: 9 George I. cap. 22.&mdash;Setting fire to a
coal-mine: 10 George II. cap. 32.&mdash;Burning, or setting fire to any
wind-mill, water-mill, or other mill: (as also pulling down the same:)
9 George III. cap. 29; but the offender must be prosecuted within
eighteen months.&mdash;Burning any ship; to the prejudice of the owners,
freighters, or underwriters: 22 and 23 Charles II. cap. 11; 1 Anne,
stat. 2. cap. 9; 4 George I. cap. 12.&mdash;Burning the King's ships of war
afloat, or building: or the Dock-yards, or any of the buildings,
arsenals, or stores therein: 12 George III. cap. 24.&mdash;And finally,
<i>Threatening</i> by anonymous or fictitious letters to burn houses,
barns, &amp;c. is by the Act 27 George II. cap. 15, also made felony
without Benefit of Clergy.</p>

<p>Burglary is a felony at common law; it is described to be <i>when a
person, by night, breaketh into the mansion of another, with an intent
to commit a felony; whether the felonious intent be executed or not</i>.</p>

<p>By the 18th of Elizabeth, cap. 7, the Benefit of Clergy is taken away
from <i>The Offence</i>; and by the 3d and 4th William and Mary, cap. 9,
from <i>Accessaries before the fact</i>.&mdash;By the 12th of Anne, stat. 1,
cap. 7, if any person shall enter into a mansion or dwelling house, by
day or by night, without breaking into the same, with an intent to
commit any felony; or being in such houses, shall commit any felony;
and shall, in the night time, <i>break</i> the said house <i>to get out</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">-58-</a></span>
the same, he is declared guilty of the offence of burglary, and
punished accordingly.</p>

<p>It is, without doubt, highly expedient that this Offence should be
punished more severely than any other species of theft; since, besides
the loss of property, there is something very terrific in the mode of
perpetration, which is often productive of dreadful effects.</p>

<p>The ancient laws made a marked distinction in the punishment, between
this Offence, which was called Hamsokne, (and which name it retains at
present in the Northern parts of this kingdom) and robbing a house in
the day time.</p>

<p>There are many other felonies which have been made capital
(particularly within the present century) which do not properly fall
within the class above discussed;&mdash;for an account of these the reader
is referred to the general Catalogue of offences specified in a
subsequent Chapter.</p>

<p>The number of these various capital Offences upon which the judgment
of death must be pronounced, if the party is found guilty, has been
already stated to amount to above one <i>hundred and sixty</i>.&mdash;And yet if
a full consideration shall be given to the subject, it is believed
that (excepting in cases of <i>Treason</i>, <i>Murder</i>, <i>Mayhem</i>, and some
aggravated instances of Arsonry) it would be found that the punishment
of death is neither politic nor expedient.</p>

<p>At any rate, it must be obvious to every reasoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">-59-</a></span> mind, that such
<i>indiscriminate rigour</i>, by punishing the petty pilferer with the same
severity as the atrocious murderer, cannot easily be reconciled to the
rights of nature or to the principles of morality.</p>

<p>It is indeed true, in point of practice, that in most cases of a
slight nature, the mercy of Judges, of Juries, or of the Sovereign,
saves the delinquent; but is not the exercise of this mercy rendered
so necessary on every occasion, "<i>a tacit disapprobation of the
laws</i>?"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Cruelty, in punishment for slight Offences, often induces Offenders to
pass on from the trifling to the most atrocious crime.&mdash;Thus are these
our miserable fellow-mortals rendered desperate; whilst the laws,
which ought to soften the ferocity of obdurate minds, tend to corrupt
and harden them.</p>

<p>What education is to an individual, the Laws are to Society. Wherever
they are sanguinary, delinquents will be hard-hearted, desperate, and
even barbarous.</p>

<p>However much our ancestors were considered as behind us in
civilization, yet their laws were infinitely milder, in many
instances, than in the present age of refinement.</p>

<p>The real good of the State, however, unquestionably requires that not
only adequate punishments should be impartially inflicted, but that
the injured should obtain a reparation for their wrongs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">-60-</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of such reparation, it has been already stated, and indeed it
is much to be lamented, that many are induced to desist from
prosecutions, and even to conceal injuries, because nothing but
expence and trouble is to be their lot: as all the fruits of the
conviction, where the criminal has any property, go to the
State.&mdash;That the State should be the only immediate gainer by the
fines and forfeitures of criminals, while the injured party suffers,
seems not wholly consonant to the principles either of <i>justice</i>,
<i>equity</i>, or <i>sound policy</i>.</p>

<p>Having said thus much on the subject of severe and sanguinary
Punishments, it may not be improper to mention a very recent and
modern authority, for the total abolition of the Punishment of death.
This occurred in the Imperial Dominion, where a new code of criminal
law was promulgated by the late Emperor, <span class="smcap">Joseph</span> II. and legalised by
his edict in 1787.</p>

<p>This Code, formed in an enlightened age, by Princes, Civilians, and
Men of Learning, who sat down to the deliberation assisted by the
wisdom and experience of former ages, and by all the information
possible with regard to the practice of civilized modern nations; with
an impression also upon their minds, that sanguinary punishments, by
death, torture, or dismemberment are not necessary, and ought to be
abolished; becomes an interesting circumstance in the annals of the
world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">-61-</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">The Emperor</span> <i>in his edict signed at Vienna the 13th of
January, 1787, declares his intention to have been to give a
precise and invariable form to Criminal Judicature; to
prevent arbitrary interpretations; to draw a due line
between criminal and civil offences, and those against the
state; to observe a just proportion between offences and
punishments, and to determine the latter in such a manner as
that they may make more than merely a transient
impression.&mdash;Having promulgated this new code, he abrogates,
annuls, and declares void all the ancient laws which
formerly existed in his dominions</i>.&mdash;Forbidding at the same
time every criminal Judge to exercise the functions of his
office, on any but those who shall be brought before him,
accused of a criminal offence expressed in the new code."</p>
</div>

<p>This system of criminal law is so concise as to be comprehended in
less than one hundred octavo pages. It commences with laying down
certain general principles, favourable in their nature both to
humanity and public liberty.&mdash;In determining the Punishments (which
will hereafter be very shortly detailed) the following rules are laid
down for the Judges.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>The criminal Judge should be intent on observing the just
proportion between a criminal Offence and the punishment
assigned it, and carefully to compare every
circumstance.&mdash;With respect to the</i> Offence, <i>his principal
attention should be directed to the degree of malignity
accompanying the bad action,&mdash;to the importance of the
circumstance connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">-62-</a></span> Offence,&mdash;to the degree of
damage which may result from it,&mdash;to the possibility or
impossibility of the precautions which might have been made
use of to prevent it.&mdash;With respect to the</i> Criminal, <i>the
attention of the Judge should be directed to his youth,&mdash;to
the temptation or imprudence attending it,&mdash;to the
punishment which has been inflicted for the same Offence,
and to the danger of a relapse</i>."</p>

<p>In contemplating the various component parts of this Code, it is easy
to discover that although some features of it may be worthy of
imitation, upon the whole it is not suited either to the English
constitution or the genius of our people. It is, however, a curious
and interesting document, from which considerable information may be
drawn; if ever that period shall arrive when a revision of our own
criminal Code (in many respects more excellent than this) shall become
an object of consideration with the Legislature.&mdash;At all events it
strongly evinces the necessity of adapting the laws to the
circumstances and situation of the Government; and of the people whose
vices are to be restrained.</p>

<p>The total abolition of the Punishment of death (excepting in military
offences cognizable by Courts Martial) is a very prominent feature in
this Code; which appears to have been founded in a great measure on
the principles laid down by the Marquis Beccaria, in his Essay on
Crimes and Punishments: That able writer establishes it as a maxim,
which indeed will scarcely be controverted&mdash;"That the severity of
Punishment should just be sufficient to excite compassion in the
spectators, as it is intended more for them than the criminal.&mdash;A
punishment, to be just, should have only that degree of severity which
is sufficient to deter others, and no more"&mdash;This authour further
asserts, "That perpetual labour has in it all that is necessary to
deter the most hardened and determined, as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">-72-</a></span> as the punishment of
death, <i>where every example supposes a new crime</i>:&mdash;perpetual labour
on the other hand, affords a frequent and lasting example."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless, the fundamental principle of good legislation is, rather to
prevent crimes than to punish.&mdash;If a mathematical expression may be
made use of, relative to the good and evil of human life, it is the
art of conducting men to the <i>maximum</i> of happiness and the <i>minimum</i>
of misery.</p>

<p>But in spite of all the efforts of human wisdom, aided by the lights
of Philosophy, and freed from the mist of prejudice or the bigotry of
darker ages;&mdash;In spite of the best laws, and the most correct system
of Police which the most enlightened Legislature can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">-73-</a></span> form: it will
not be altogether possible, amid the various opposite attractions of
pleasure and pain, to reduce the tumultuous activity of mankind to
absolute regularity:&mdash;We can only hope for a considerable reduction of
the evils that exist.&mdash;<i>Let the Laws be clear and simple;&mdash;let the
entire force of the Nation be united in their defence; let the Laws be
feared, and the Laws only.</i></p>

<p><span class="cap">I</span>N a <a href="#CHAPTER_I">preceding Chapter</a> the small thefts committed by persons not known

enormous sum of £.700,000 a year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">-75-</a></span></p>

<p>This discovery (except what relates to embezzled silk, cotton, and
worsted) was originally made through the medium of a considerable
Dealer in Rags and Old Iron, and other Metals, who communicated to the
Author much interesting information, respecting Receivers of stolen
Goods, confirmed afterwards through other channels, the substance of
which has been already alluded to; and of which the following are more
ample details:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>That there exists in this Metropolis, (and also in all the
towns where his Majesty's Dock-Yards are established) a
class of Dealers, of late years become extremely numerous,
who keep open shops for the purchase of <i>Rags, Old Iron, and
other Metals</i>.</p>

<p>"That these Dealers are universally, almost without a single
exception, the Receivers of stolen Goods of every
denomination; from a nail, a skewer, a key, or a glass
bottle, up to the most valuable article of portable
household goods, merchandize, plate, or jewels, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>"That they are divided into two classes:&mdash;<i>Wholesale</i> and
<i>Retail Dealers</i>. That the Retail Dealers are generally
(with some exceptions) the immediate purchasers in the first
instance, from the pilferers or their agents; and as soon as
they collect a sufficient quantity of iron, copper, brass,
lead, tin, pewter, or other metals, worthy the notice of a
large Dealer, they dispose of the same for ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">-76-</a></span> money; by
which they are enabled to continue the trade.</p>

<p>"That the increase of these old iron, rag, and store shops
has been astonishing within the last twenty years.</p>

<p>"That, as the least trifle is received, the vigilance of the
parties, from whom the articles are stolen, is generally
eluded; by the prevailing practice of taking only a small
quantity of any article at a time.</p>

<p>"That the articles thus received are generally purchased at
about one-third of the real value, and seldom at more than
half;&mdash;glass bottles in particular, are bought at one penny
each, and no question asked:&mdash;they are afterwards sold to
dealers in this particular branch, who assort and wash them,
and again re-sell them to inferior wine-dealers at nearly
the full value:&mdash;this has become, of late, an extensive line
of trade.</p>

<p>"That further facilities are afforded by the dealers in old
iron, in the collection of metals, rags, and other articles
purloined and stolen in the Country; which are conveyed to
town by means of <i>single-horse carts</i>, kept by itinerant
Jews, and other doubtful characters; who travel to
Portsmouth, Chatham, Woolwich, Deptford, and places in the
vicinity of London, for the purpose of purchasing metals
from persons who are in the habit of embezzling the King's
stores, or from dealers on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">-77-</a></span> spot, who are the first
receivers; from them, <i>copper-bolts, nails, spikes, iron,
brass, lead, pewter</i>, and other ship articles of
considerable value are procured.&mdash;These single-horse carts
have increased greatly of late years, and have become very
profitable to the proprietors.</p>

<p>"That some of these dealers in old metals, notoriously keep
men employed in knocking the broad Arrow, or King's mark,
out of the copper-bolts, nails, and bar iron, whereon it is
impressed, and also in cutting such bar iron into portable
lengths, after which it is sold to the great dealers, who
supply the Public Boards; and who are in some instances
supposed by this means to sell the same Article to these
boards even <i>two</i> or <i>three</i> times over.</p>

<p>"That the trade thus carried on, is exceedingly productive
both to the retail and wholesale dealers; many of whom are
become extremely opulent, and carry on business to the
extent of from ten to thirty, and in some few instances,
fifty thousand a year in old metals alone.</p>

<p>"That the quantity of new nails, taken from the public
repositories, and from private workshops, and disposed of at
the old iron shops exceeds all credibility.</p>

<p>"And finally, that the retail dealers in old iron, with some
exceptions, are the principal purchasers of the pewter pots
stolen from the Publicans, which they instantly melt down
(if not previously done) to elude detection."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">-78-</a></span></p>

<p>Thus are the lower ranks of Society assailed on all hands; and in a
manner allured to be dishonest, by the ready means of disposing of
property, unlawfully acquired, to satisfy <i>imaginary</i> and too
frequently <i>criminal</i> wants, excited by the temptations which the
amusements and dissipations of a great Capital, and the delusion of
the Lottery, hold out.</p>

<p>The rapid growth of this Evil within the last twenty years, and the
effect it has upon the morals of menial servants and others, who must
in the nature of things have a certain trust committed to them, is a
strong reason why some effectual remedy should be administered as
speedily as possible.</p>

<p>It seems, under all circumstances, that the regulation of these
Iron-shops, by licence, and by other restrictions connected with the
public security, has become a matter of immediate necessity; for it is
a dreadful thing to reflect that there should exist and grow up, in so
short a period of time, such a body of criminal dealers, who are
permitted to exercise all the mischievous part of the functions of
Pawnbrokers; enjoying equal benefits, without any of the restrictions
which have already been extended to this last class of dealers; who
themselves also require further regulations, which will be hereafter
discussed.</p>

<p>But beside the dealers in <i>old iron</i>, it will be necessary to extend
the regulation proposed, to dealers in <i>second-hand wearing apparel</i>,
whether <i>stationary</i> or <i>itinerant</i>; for through this medium also, a
vast quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">-79-</a></span> of bed and table linen, sheets, wearing apparel, and
other articles, pilfered in private families, is disposed of; and
money is obtained, without asking questions, with the same facility as
at the iron shops.</p>

<p>To prevent metals from being melted by Receivers of stolen Goods, and
other persons keeping crucibles and melting vessels, by which means
the most infamous frauds are committed, to the evasion of justice, by
immediately melting plate, pewter pots, and every kind of metal that
can be identified; it may be also necessary to regulate, by licence,
all <i>Founders of metal</i>, and also the horse and truck carts used for
the purpose of conveying old metals from place to place: so as, upon
the whole, to establish a <i>mild, but complete System of Prevention</i>;
by limiting the dealers in old metals and second-hand wearing apparel,
to the honest and fair part of their trade, and by restraining them
with regard to that which is fraudulent and mischievous.</p>

<p>At present these respective dealers may truly be said to be complete
pests of Society.&mdash;They are not, like Pawnbrokers, restrained, as to
the hours of receiving or delivering goods.&mdash;Their dealings are often
in the night time, by which means they enjoy every opportunity of
encouraging fraud and dishonesty.</p>

<p>It is impossible to contemplate the consequences arising from the
seduction of so many individuals, young and old, who must be
implicated in the crimes which these abominable receptacles encourage,
with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">-80-</a></span>out wishing to see so complicate and growing a mischief engage
the immediate attention of the Legislature, that a remedy may be
applied as early as possible.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>This System of petty thievery and general depredation is, however, by
no means confined to the precincts of the Metropolis: it is extended
in a peculiar manner through the different Counties in its
Vicinity.&mdash;The following particulars, extracted from Mr. <i>Middleton's</i>
View of the Agriculture of <i>Middlesex</i>, will enable the Reader to form
some judgment of the extent of the mischief, and the causes from which
it originates; producing and increasing that band of plunderers, of
which the Metropolis itself has ultimately been at once the Nurse and
the Victim.</p>

<p>"The funds raised for supporting the <i>Idle Poor of this country</i> (says
this intelligent writer) are so numerous, efficient, and comfortable,
as to operate against the general industry of the <i>Labouring Poor</i>.</p>

<p>"Lodging and diet in the workhouses, in every instance, are superior
to what the industrious labourer can provide for his family. It is
obvious that this must have an influence over their minds, and become
most injurious to the interests of society; it holds out encouragement
to prefer the workhouse to labour; and, by filling the poor houses
with improper inhabitants, it reduces the amount of industry."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">-81-</a></span></p>

<p>The annual expence of each pauper is calculated by the same Writer at
about <i>Fifteen Guineas</i>; a stout healthy labourer in husbandry, with a
wife and three children, earns only Thirty for the support of five
persons.</p>

<p>"The want of prudence is increased, and general industry lessened, on
the part of the poor, by the facility with which voluntary
contributions are raised during every temporary inconvenience, such as
a few weeks' frost, or an extraordinary advance in the price of
provisions.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> And also by the constantly cloathing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">-82-</a></span> upwards of ten
thousand children of the labouring Poor in this Country.</p>

<p>"Every institution which tends to make the poor depend on any other
support than their own industry does them great disservice, and is
highly injurious to society, by diminishing the quantity of labour
which annually produces consumable goods, the only wealth of a
nation."</p>

<p>Although these suggestions may appear harsh, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">-83-</a></span> some of them may
admit of more extended discussion, yet they certainly deserve very
serious consideration; as do also the following observations on the
Commons and Waste Lands with which this kingdom still abounds; and on
the general character of Servants and Labourers; the latter of which
afford but too melancholy a confirmation of many opinions which the
author of this treatise has thought it his duty to bring forward to
the Public eye.</p>

<p>"On estimating the value of the Commons in Middlesex, including every
advantage that can be derived from them in pasturage, locality of
situation, and the barbarous custom of turbary, it appears that <i>they
do not produce to the Community, in their present state, more than
four shillings per Acre</i>! On the other hand, they are, in many
instances, of real injury to the Public, by holding out a lure to the
poor man; by affording him materials wherewith to build his cottage,
and ground to erect it upon; together with firing, and the run of his
poultry and pigs for nothing. This is, of course, temptation
sufficient to induce a great number of poor persons to settle upon the
borders of such Commons. But the mischief does not end here; for
having gained these trifling advantages, through the neglect or
connivance of the Lord of the Manor, it unfortunately gives their
minds an improper bias, and inculcates a desire to live, from that
time forward, without labour, or at least with as little as possible.</p>

<p>"The animals kept by this description of persons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">-84-</a></span> it is soon
discovered by their owners, are not likely to afford them much
revenue, without better feed than the scanty herbage on a Common;
hence they are tempted to pilfer corn, &amp;c. towards their support; and
as they are still dependant on such a deceptious supply, to answer the
demands of their consumption, they are in some measure constrained to
resort to various dishonest means, so as to make up the deficiency.</p>

<p>"It is a notorious fact, that in all cases cottages not having any
ground belonging to them promote thieving to a great extent; as their
inhabitants constantly rob the neighbouring farms and gardens of root
and pulse sufficient for their own consumption, and which they would
have no temptation to do, if they had the same articles growing of
their own." Hence Mr. Middleton suggests the evil admits of an easy
remedy, namely, the allotting to each cottager a piece of ground.</p>

<p>"Another very serious evil which the Public suffers from these Commons
is, that they are the constant rendezvous of Gypsies, Strollers, and
other loose persons, living under tents which they carry with them
from place to place, according to their conveniency. Most of these
persons have asses, many of them horses, nay, some of them have even
covered carts, which answer the double purpose of a caravan for
concealing and carrying off the property they have stolen, and also of
a house for sleeping in at night. They usually stay a week or two at a
place;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">-85-</a></span> and the cattle which they keep serve to transport their few
articles of furniture from one place to another. These, during the
stay of their owners, are turned adrift to procure what food they can
find in the neighbourhood of their tents, and the deficiency is made
up from the adjacent hay-stacks, barns and granaries. They are known
never to buy any hay or corn, and yet their cattle are supplied with
these articles of good quality. The women and children beg and pilfer,
and the men commit greater acts of dishonesty. <i>In short, the Commons
of this Country are well known to be the constant resort of footpads
and highwaymen, and are literally and proverbially a public
nuisance.</i>"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>The Labourers of this country are ruined in morals and constitution
by the public houses.</i> It is a general rule, that the higher their
wages, the less they carry home, and consequently the greater is the
wretchedness of themselves and their families. Comforts in a cottage
are mostly found where the man's wages are low, at least so low as to
require him to labour six days a week. For instance, a good workman at
nine shillings per week, if advanced to twelve will spend a day in the
week at the alehouse, which reduces his labour to five days, or ten
shillings; and as he will spend two shillings in the public house, it
leaves but eight for his family, which is one less than they had when
he earned only nine shillings.</p>

<p>"If by any means he be put into a situation of earning eighteen
shillings in six days, he will get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">-86-</a></span> drunk Sunday and Monday, and go to
his work stupid on Tuesday; and should he be a mechanical journeyman
of some genius, who by constant labour could earn twenty-four
shillings or thirty shillings per week, as some of them can, he will
be drunk half the week, insolent to his employer, and to every person
about him.</p>

<p>"If his master has business in hand that requires particular dispatch,
he will then, more than at any other time, be absent from his work,
and his wife and children will experience the extreme of hunger, rags
and cold.</p>

<p>"The low <i>Inns on the road sides</i> are, in general, receiving houses
for the corn, hay, straw, poultry, eggs, &amp;c. which the farmers' men
pilfer from their masters.</p>

<p>"<i>Gentlemen's Servants</i> are mostly a bad set, and the great number
kept in this county, is the means of the rural labourers acquiring a
degree of idleness and insolence unknown in places more remote from
the Metropolis.</p>

<p>"The poor children who are brought up on the borders of commons and
copses, are accustomed to little labour, but too much idleness and
pilfering. Having grown up, and these latter qualities having become a
part of their nature, they are then introduced to the farmers as
servants or labourers; and very bad ones they make.</p>

<p>"The children of small farmers, on the contrary, have the picture of
industry, hard labour, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">-87-</a></span> honesty, hourly before them, in the
persons of their <i>parents</i>, and daily hear the complaints which <i>they</i>
make against idle and pilfering servants, and comparisons drawn highly
in favour of honesty. In this manner honesty and industry become, as
it were, a part of the nature of such young folks. The father's
property is small, and his means few; he is therefore unable to hire
and stock a farm for each of his children; they consequently become
servants on large farms, or in gentlemen's families, and in either
situation are the most faithful part of such establishments."&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"One great hindrance to comfort in a life of agriculture, and which
drives liberal minded men, who are always the best friends to
improvement, out of the profession, is the want of laws to put a total
stop to the Receivers of stolen goods. These are the wretches who
encourage servants in agriculture, and others to pilfer, by holding
out the lure of buying every article, which such servants can bring
without asking them any questions. Most things which are usually
produced on a farm, from so small an article as an egg, to hay, straw
and grain of all sorts are daily stolen,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and sold on the sides of
every principal road in this county. Among the Receivers are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">-88-</a></span> be
reckoned Millers, Cornchandlers, Dealers in eggs, butter and poultry,
and the Keepers of Chandlers' shops.</p>

<p>"The Drivers of Gentlemen's carriages are intrusted to buy hay, straw,
and corn, for their horses; in the doing which, they generally cheat
their masters of 5<i>s.</i> in each load of hay, of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in each
load of straw, and 1<i>s.</i> in every quarter of corn. This gives them an
interest in the consumption, makes them extremely wasteful, and brings
on habits of dishonesty.</p>

<p>"The Ostlers at the Inns on the sides of the roads, purchase stolen
hay, straw, corn, eggs, and poultry. A person who kept a horse several
weeks at one of these inns, in attending occasionally to see the
animal, discovered him to be fed with wheat, barley and oats mixed
together, which could only happen by the farmers' servants robbing
their Master, and selling the corn to the Ostler."&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"The fields near London are never free from men strolling about in
pilfering pursuits by day, and committing great crimes by night. The
depredations every Sunday are astonishingly great. There are not many
gardens within five miles of London, that escape being visited in a
marauding way, very early on a Sunday morning, and the farmers' fields
are plundered all day long of fruit, roots, cabbages, pulse and corn.
Even the ears of wheat are cut from the sheaves, and carried away in
the most daring manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">-89-</a></span> in open day, in various ways, but mostly in
bags containing about half a bushel each. It has been moderately
estimated, that 20,000 bushels of all the various sorts are thus
carried off every Sunday morning, and 10,000 more during the other six
days of the week; or one million and a half of bushels in a year,
which, if valued at so small a sum as sixpence each, would amount to
£37,500.</p>

<p>"The occupiers of many thousand acres round London, lose annually in
this manner to the amount of much more than 20<i>s.</i> an acre.</p>

<p>"A Miller near London being questioned as to small parcels of wheat
brought to his mill to be ground, by a suspected person, soon after
several barns had been robbed, answered, that any explanation on that
head would put his mills in danger of being burnt. Well may the
<i>farmers</i> say, 'Their <i>property is not protected like that of other
men</i>.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Middleton calculates that the depredations committed on the landed
interest probably amount to 4<i>s.</i> an acre per annum, on all the
cultivated lands in England, or to eight millions of pounds sterling
per annum: and including the injuries done by game and vermin, he
supposes, that the farmers' property suffers to the amount of 10<i>s.</i>
an acre, or nearly twenty millions annually.</p>

<p>The following curious circumstances relative to the adulteration of
<i>Milk</i> in the Metropolis, ought to be added to the list of petty
frauds, which not merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">-90-</a></span> affect the pockets but the health of the
inhabitants of London. The number of milch cows kept for the purpose
of supplying the Metropolis with this article, is stated by Mr.
<i>Middleton</i>, after very diligent inquiry, at 8,500; and each cow is
supposed to afford on an average nine quarts of milk per day.&mdash;</p>

<p>"When the families of fashion are in London for the winter season, the
consumption, and consequent deterioration of milk are at the highest;
during the summer months, when such families are for the most part in
the country, the milk may probably be of rather a better quality.</p>

<p>"The milk is always given in its genuine state to the retail dealers;
and as it is sold to them by the Cow-keepers after the rate of
twopence and 1-8th of a penny per quart, and is retailed by them at
threepence halfpenny per quart, the profit is surely so large as ought
to prevent even the smallest adulteration. But when it is considered
how greatly it is reduced <i>by water</i>, and impregnated with <i>worse</i>
ingredients, it is much to be lamented that no method has yet been
devised to put a stop to the many scandalous frauds and impositions in
general practice, with regard to this very necessary article of human
sustenance.</p>

<p>"It is certainly an object well deserving the particular consideration
of the Legislature. It cannot be doubted, that many persons would be
glad to make some addition to the price now paid for it (high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">-91-</a></span> as that
price is) provided they could, for such increased price, procure so
useful an article in domestic &#339;conomy perfectly genuine.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>"Five or six men only are employed in attending near three hundred
cows. As one woman cannot milk above eight or nine cows twice a day,
that part of the business would necessarily be attended with
considerable expence to the Cow-keeper, were it not that the Retailer
agrees for the produce of a certain number of cows, and takes the
labour and expence of milking on himself.</p>

<p>"Every Cow-house is provided with a milk-room (where the milk is
measured and served out by the Cow-keeper) and this room is mostly
furnished with <i>a pump</i>, to which the Retail Dealers apply in
rotation; not secretly, but openly before any person that may be
standing by, from which they pump water into the milk vessels at their
discretion. The pump is placed there expressly for that purpose, and
indeed is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">-92-</a></span> seldom used for any other. A considerable Cow-keeper
in Surrey has a pump of this kind, which goes, by the name of the
<i>Famous Black Cow</i> (from the circumstance of its being painted black)
<i>and is said to yield more than all the rest put together</i>.</p>

<p>"Where such a pump is not provided for them things are much worse, for
in that case the Retailers are not even careful to use <i>clean</i> water.
Some of them have been seen to dip their pails in a common
horse-trough. And what is still more disgusting, though equally true,
one cow-house happens to stand close to the edge of a stream, into
which runs much of the dung, and most of the urine of the cows, and
even in this stream, so foully impregnated, they have been observed to
dip their milk-pails.</p>

<p>"A Cow-keeper informs me, that the Retail Milk Dealers are for the
most part the refuse of other employments, possessing neither
character, decency of manners, nor cleanliness.</p>

<p>"No person could possibly drink of the milk, were they fully
acquainted with the filthy manners of these dealers in it.</p>

<p>"The same person suggests, <i>as a remedy for these abuses, that it
would be highly proper for every Retail Milk Dealer to be obliged to
take out an Annual Licence from the Magistrates</i>; which licence should
be granted only to such as could produce a certificate of good
conduct, signed by the Cow-keeper and a certain number of their
customers; and also on their being sworn to sell the milk pure and
unadulterated."</p>

<p><span class="cap">I</span>T is impossible to reflect upon the outrages and acts of violence
continually committed, more particularly in and near the Metropolis by
lawless ravagers of property, and destroyers of lives, in disturbing
the peaceful mansion, <i>the Castle of every Englishman</i>, and also in
abridging the liberty of travelling upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">-94-</a></span> Public Highways, without
asking&mdash;<i>Why are these enormities suffered in a Country where the
Criminal Laws are supposed to have arrived at a greater degree of
perfection than any other?</i></p>

<p>This is an important inquiry, interesting in the highest degree, to
every member of the Body Politic.</p>

<p>If, in pursuing such an inquiry, the situation of Holland, Flanders,
and several of the Northern States on the Continent, be examined, it
will be found that this terrific evil had (alluding to these States
previous to the present war) there scarcely an existence: and, that
the precaution of bolting doors and windows during the night, was even
seldom used; although, in these Countries, from the opulence of many
of the inhabitants, there were great temptations to plunder property.</p>

<p>This security did not proceed from <i>severer punishments</i>, for in very
few Countries are they more sanguinary than in England.&mdash;It is to be
attributed to a more correct and energetic system of Police, joined to
an early and general attention to the employment, education, and
morals of the lower orders of the people; a habit of industry and
sobriety is thus acquired, which, universally imbibed in early life,
"grows with their growth, and strengthens with their strength."</p>

<p>Idleness is a never-failing road to criminality. It originates
generally in the inattention and the bad example of profligate
parents.&mdash;And when it has unfortunately taken hold of the human mind,
unneces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">-95-</a></span>sary wants and improper gratifications, not known or thought
of by persons in a course of industry, are constantly generated: hence
it is, that crimes are resorted to, and every kind of violence,
hostile to the laws, and to peace and good order, is perpetrated.</p>

<p>The criminal and unfortunate individuals, who compose the dismal
catalogue of Highwaymen, Footpad-Robbers, Burglars, Pick-Pockets, and
common Thieves, in and about this Metropolis, may be divided into the
three following classes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Young men of some education, who having acquired idle
habits by abandoning business, or by being bred to no
profession, and having been seduced by this idleness to
indulge in gambling and scenes of debauchery and
dissipation, at length impoverished and unable to purchase
their accustomed gratifications, have recourse to the
highway to supply immediate wants.</p>

<p>2. Tradesmen and others, who having ruined their fortunes
and business by gaming and dissipation, sometimes as a
desperate remedy, go upon the road.</p></div>

<p>But these two classes are extremely few in number, and bear no
proportion to the lower and more depraved part of the fraternity of
thieves, who pursue the trade systematically; who conduct their
depredations under such circumstances of caution, as to render
detection extremely difficult; and whose knowledge of all the weak
parts of the Criminal Law is generally so complete, as to enable them
to elude justice, and obtain acquittals, when detected and put upon
their trial:&mdash;<i>Namely</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">-96-</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>3. 1st. Servants, Ostlers, Stable and Post-Boys out of
place, who, preferring what they consider as idleness, have
studied the profession of Thieving.&mdash;2d. Persons who being
imprisoned for debts, assaults, or petty offences, have
learned habits of idleness and profligacy in gaols.&mdash;3d.
Idle and disorderly mechanics and labourers, who having on
this account lost the confidence of their masters or
employers, resort to thieving, as a means of support; from
all whom the notorious and hacknied thieves generally select
the most trusty and daring to act as their associates.&mdash;4th.
Criminals tried and acquitted of offences charged against
them, of which class a vast number is annually let loose
upon Society.&mdash;5th. Convicts discharged from prison and the
Hulks, after suffering the sentence of the Law: too often
instructed by one another in all the arts and devices which
attach to the most extreme degree of human depravity, and in
the perfect knowledge of the means of perpetrating Crimes,
and of eluding Justice.</p></div>

<p>To form some judgment of the number of persons in this great
Metropolis who compose at least a part of the Criminal Phalanx engaged
in depredations and acts of violence, it is only necessary to have
recourse to the following Statement of the number of prisoners
discharged, during a period of four years, from the eight different
Gaols in the Metropolis, and within the Bills of Mortality.</p>

<table style="width: 80%" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" summary="convicts">

<p>Humanity shudders at the contemplation of this interesting part of the
discussion, when it is considered, who these our miserable
fellow-mortals are! and what is to be expected from the extreme
depravity which attaches to the chief part of them!</p>

<p>And here a prominent feature of the imperfect state of the Police of
the Metropolis and the Country is too evident to escape notice.</p>

<p><i>Without friends, without character, and without the means of
subsistence</i>, what are these unhappy mortals to do?&mdash;They are no
sooner known or suspected, than they are avoided.&mdash;No person will
employ them, even if they were disposed to return to the paths of
honesty; unless they make use of fraud and deception, by concealing
that they have been the inhabitants of a <i>Prison</i>, or of the <i>Hulks</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">-99-</a></span></p>

<p>At large upon the world, without food or raiment, and with the
constant calls of nature upon them for both, without a home or any
asylum to shelter them from the inclemency of the weather, <i>what is to
become of them</i>?</p>

<p>The Police of the Country has provided no place of industry, in which
those who were disposed to reform might find subsistence in return for
voluntary labour; which, in their present situation, becomes useless
to them, because no person will purchase it by employing them.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Under all these circumstances it is to be feared, indeed it is known,
that many Convicts, from dire necessity, return to their old
courses.&mdash;And thus, through the medium of these miserable outcasts of
Society, crimes are increased and become a regular trade, because many
of them can make no other election.</p>

<p>It is indeed true, that during the first three years of the present
war, many Convicts and idle and disorderly persons were sent to the
Army and Navy: but still a vast number remained behind, who could not
be accepted on account of ruptures, fits, or some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">-100-</a></span> other disability or
infirmity; which, although they incapacitate them from serving his
Majesty, do not prevent them from committing crimes.</p>

<p>While it must be evident, that the resource afforded by the present
war, gives employment, for a time only, to many depraved characters
and mischievous members of the community; how necessary is it to be
provided with antidotes, previous to the return of peace; when, to the
multitude of thieves now at large, there will be added numbers of the
same class, who may be discharged from the Navy and Army?&mdash;If some
plan of employment is not speedily devised, to which all persons of
this description may resort, who cannot otherwise subsist themselves
in an honest way; and if the Police of the Metropolis is not greatly
improved, by the introduction of more energy, and a greater degree of
System and Method in its administration; it is much to be feared, that
no existing power will be able to keep them within bounds.</p>

<p>It is in vain to say the Laws are sufficient.&mdash;They are indeed
abundantly voluminous, and in many respects very excellent, but they
require to be revised, consolidated, modernized, and adapted in a
greater degree to the prevention of existing evils, with such
regulations as would ensure their due execution not only <i>in every
part of the Capital</i>, but also in all parts of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>The means these depredators at present use in accomplishing their
nefarious purposes are complicated and various; and of late years have
become as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">-101-</a></span> diversified as it is possible for the ingenuity of men
to devise, who frequently join good natural abilities to all the
artifices of the finished villain.</p>

<p>It is no uncommon thing for the more daring and strong-minded to form
themselves into gangs or societies; to the exclusion of those of their
fraternity whose hearts are likely to fail them, and who are supposed
not to be sufficiently firm, so as to secure their accomplices against
the hazard of discovery in case of detection.</p>

<p>Robbery and theft, as well in houses as on the roads, have long been
reduced to a regular System. Opportunities are watched, and
intelligence procured, with a degree of vigilance similar to that
which marks the conduct of a skilful General, eager to obtain an
advantage over an enemy.</p>

<p>Houses, intended to be entered during the night, are previously
reconnoitred and examined for days preceding. If one or more of the
servants are not already associated with the gang, the most artful
means are used to obtain their assistance; and when every previous
arrangement is made, the mere operation of robbing a house becomes a
matter of little difficulty.</p>

<p>By the connivance and assistance of immediate, or former servants,
they are led to the places where the most valuable, as well as the
most portable, articles are deposited, and the object is speedily
attained.</p>

<p>In this manner do the principal Burglars and House-breakers proceed:
and let this information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">-102-</a></span> serve as a caution to every person in the
choice both of their male and female servants; since the latter as
well as the former are not seldom accomplices in very atrocious
robberies.</p>

<p>The same <i>generalship</i> is manifested in the nocturnal expeditions of
those criminal associates upon the highways.</p>

<p>A perfect knowledge is obtained every evening of the different routes
and situations of the patroles:&mdash;they are narrowly watched, and their
vigilance (wherever they are vigilant) is in too many instances
defeated.</p>

<p>Infinite pains are bestowed in procuring intelligence of persons
travelling upon the road with money, bank-notes, or other valuable
effects; and when discovered, the most masterly pains are concerted to
waylay and rob them of their property: Nor have the measures pursued
by those atrocious villains, the Footpads, exhibited less skill in the
plans adopted; while their outrages are too often marked with those
acts of cruelty and barbarity which justly render them objects of
peculiar terror.</p>

<p>The same adroitness also marks the conduct of those who turn their
attention chiefly to picking of pockets, and other smaller robberies.</p>

<p>It would almost fill a volume to detail the various artifices which
are resorted to, in carrying on this species of thieving; by which
even the most cautious, and those who are generally upon their guard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">-103-</a></span>
are not exempted from the ravages of these inferior pests of Society.</p>

<p>In addition to the injuries or losses arising from burglaries,
highway-robberies and lesser thefts, it is to be lamented that
extensive and increasing depredations are made upon horses, cattle and
sheep, and also upon flour, corn, potatoes, provender, and poultry;
stolen from the drovers, millers, corn-factors, and farmers in the
vicinity of the Metropolis. These have been stated more at large in a
<a href="#CHAP_III">preceding Chapter</a>.</p>

<p>It cannot be too often repeated that the great facility experienced,
in the immediate disposal of every article obtained by dishonesty, is
one of the chief encouragements to all the acts of outrage and
depredation enumerated in the course of this Work.</p>

<p>It frequently happens that the Burglars, the Highwaymen, and Footpad
robbers, make their contracts with the Receivers, on the evening
before the plunder is obtained; so as to secure a ready admittance
immediately afterwards, and before day-break, for the purpose of
effectual concealment by melting plate, obliterating marks, and
securing all other articles so as to place them out of the reach of
discovery. This has long been reduced to a regular system which is
understood and followed as a trade.</p>

<p>Nor do those Thieves who steal horses,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> cattle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">-104-</a></span> sheep
experience more difficulty in finding purchasers immediately for
whatever they can obtain:&mdash;they too, generally, make a previous
bargain with the Receivers, who are ready at an appointed hour to
conceal the animals, to kill them immediately, and to destroy the
skins for the purpose of eluding detection.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens also, that the persons who perpetrate these
robberies are journeymen-butchers, by trade; who kill whatever they
steal, and often afterwards sell their plunder in the Public Markets.</p>

<p>If, by wise regulations, it were possible to embarrass and disturb the
extensive trade carried on by all the <i>concealed Receivers</i>, who are
the particular class having connection with the professed thieves, a
very great check would be given to public depredations.</p>

<p>In suggesting Remedies, this of all other appears, at first view, to
be the most difficult; because of the apparent impossibility of
regulating any class of Dealers who have no shop, or visible trade,
and who transact all their business under concealment:&mdash;but still the
object is to be obtained by a combination of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">-105-</a></span> different legislative
regulations, carried into execution by a consolidated, vigilant and
well-regulated Police.</p>

<p>The detail, however, of the means of detecting Receivers will, of
course, be discussed hereafter, in a <a href="#CHAP_X">subsequent Chapter</a>; at present
the following Hints will suffice.</p>

<p>A register of lodging-houses and lodgers in every parish, liberty,
hamlet, and precinct, where the rent does not exceed a certain sum
(suppose ten shillings) weekly, would prove one great means of
embarrassment to Thieves of every class; and of course would tend,
with other regulations, to the prevention of Crimes.</p>

<p>Night-Coaches also promote, in an eminent degree, the perpetration of
burglaries and other felonies: Bribed by a high reward, many hackney
coachmen eagerly enter into the pay of nocturnal depredators, and wait
in the neighbourhood until the robbery is completed, and then draw up,
at the moment the watchmen are going their rounds, or off their
stands, for the purpose of conveying the plunder to the house of the
Receiver, who is generally waiting the issue of the enterprise. Above
one half of the present Hackney Coachmen, in London, are said to be
(in the cant phrase) <i>Flashmen</i> designed to assist thieves.</p>

<p>It being certain that a vast deal of mischief is done which could not
be effected, were it not for the assistance which night coaches afford
to Thieves of every description, it would seem, upon the whole,
advan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">-106-</a></span>tageous to the Public, that no Hackney Coaches should be
permitted to take fares after twelve o'clock at night; or, if this is
impracticable, that the coach-hire for night service should be
advanced, on condition that all coachmen going upon the stands after
twelve o'clock, should be licensed by a Board of Police. By this means
the night-coachmen, by being more select, would not be so open to
improper influence; and they might even become useful to Public
Justice in giving informations, and also in detecting Burglars, and
other Thieves.</p>

<p>Watchmen and Patroles, instead of being, as now, comparatively of
little use, from their <i>age, infirmity, inability, inattention</i>, or
<i>corrupt practices</i>, might almost at the present expence, by a proper
selection, and a more correct mode of discipline, by means of a
general superintendance over the whole to regulate their conduct, and
keep them to their duty, be rendered of great utility in preventing
Crimes, and in detecting Offenders.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">-107-</a></span></p>
<p>At present the System of the nightly watch is without energy,
disjointed, and governed by almost as many different Acts of
Parliament, as there are Parishes, Hamlets, Liberties, and Precincts
within the Bills of Mortality; and where the payment is as various,
running from 8&frac12;<i>d.</i> up to 2<i>s.</i> a night.</p>

<p>The Act of the 14th of George IIId. (<i>cap.</i> 90.) entituled, <i>An Act
for the better regulation of the Nightly Watch within the City and
Liberty of Westminster, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">-108-</a></span> parts adjacent</i>, contains many excellent
Regulations, but they do not extend to the eastern part of the
Metropolis; and for want of an active and superintending agency,
superior to beadles, it is believed and felt that they are not, (even
within the district included in the Act,) correctly carried into
execution: and that no small portion of those very men who are paid
for protecting the public, are not only instruments of oppression in
many instances, by extorting money most unwarrantably; but are
frequently accessaries in aiding, abetting or concealing the
commission of crimes, which it is their duty to detect and suppress.</p>

<p>If as an improvement to the preventive System, and as a check upon the
improper conduct of parochial Watchmen, a body of honest, able, and
active Officers, in the character of Police Patroles, were attached to
each Public Office, or to a General Police System with a sufficient
fund to defray the expences, to follow up informations for the
detection of negligent servants of the Public, and liberally to reward
those who were active and useful in apprehending delinquents, and in
making discoveries, tending either to the recovery of property stolen,
or to the detection of the offenders, little doubt need be
entertained, under the guidance of a Central Board and vigilant
Police, aided by zealous and active Magistrates, that such a System
would soon be established, as would go very far towards the prevention
of many atrocious crimes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">-109-</a></span></p>

<p>Among the various advantages which may thus be expected to result to
the Community from the arrangements recommended in this work, would be
<i>the suppression of Highway Robberies</i>. A desideratum impracticable in
the present state of the Police, although easy and certain under a
Police Board; having a general superintendance competent to look at
every point of danger, and with pecuniary resources equal to an object
so interesting to the inhabitants of this Metropolis.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Upon the
adoption of this important measure, therefore, (a measure so strongly
recommended by the Select Committee of the House of Commons on
Finance<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>) depends in a great degree, that security to travellers on
the highways in the vicinity of the Metropolis; the want of which, and
of many other valuable regulations, for the prevention of crimes, has
long been a reproach to the Criminal Jurisprudence, as well as the
Police, of the Country.</p>

<p><span class="cap">I</span>N a great Metropolis, like London, where trade and commerce have
arrived at such an astonishing height, and where from the extensive
transactions in the Funds, and the opulence of the People, the
interchange of property is so expanded, it ceases to be a matter of
wonder that Forgeries and Frauds should prevail, in a certain
degree:&mdash;the question of difficulty is, <i>why the Laws and the means of
prevention, have not kept pace with the progressive advancement of the
Country; so as to check and keep within bounds those nefarious
practices</i>?</p>

<p>Forgeries of the higher class, so dangerous in a commercial country,
have by the wise policy of the Executive Government, in shutting out
all hopes of the extension of the Royal Mercy to the guilty, received
a most severe check: beneficial in the highest degree to the country,
and clearly manifested by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">-112-</a></span> records of the Old Bailey, where trial
for offences of this nature certainly do not increase in number.</p>

<p>But it is to be lamented, that, with regard to petty forgeries and
frauds, this is by no means the case, for they seem to multiply and
advance with the opulence and luxury of the country; and to branch out
into innumerable different shades, varying as the fashions of the
year, and as the resources for the perpetration of this species of
fraud change their aspect.</p>

<p>When those depraved people who (to use a vulgar phrase) <i>live entirely
by their wits</i>&mdash;find that any tricks which they have practised for a
certain length of time become stale, (such as <i>pricking the belt for a
wager</i>, or <i>dropping the ring</i>) they abandon these; and have recourse
to other devices more novel, and more likely to be effectual in
cheating and defrauding the unwary.</p>

<p>One of the most prevailing and successful of these, is the fraud
practised upon shop-keepers, tradesmen, publicans, and others, by the
circulation of forged copper-plate notes and bills for small sums, of
£5. and £10. the latter purporting to be drawn, by bankers in the
manufacturing and sea-port towns, on different banking-houses in
London.</p>

<p>This species of forgery has been carried to a considerable extent
suggested no doubt by the confidence which is established from the
extensive circulation of country bankers' notes and bills, now made
payable in London; by which the deception is, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">-113-</a></span> some degree,
covered, and detection rendered more difficult.</p>

<p>The great qualifications, or leading and indispensable attributes of a
<i>Sharper</i>, a <i>Cheat</i>, a <i>Swindler</i>, or a <i>Gambler</i>, are, to possess a
genteel exterior, a demeanor apparently artless, and a good address.</p>

<p>Like the more violent depredators upon the public, this class (who are
extremely numerous) generally proceed upon a regular system, and study
as a <i>trade</i> all those infamous tricks and devices by which the
thoughtless, the ignorant, and the honest are defrauded of their
property.</p>

<p>The common law has defined the offence of cheating&mdash;to be <i>a deceitful
practice in defrauding, or endeavouring to defraud, another of his own
right, by means of some artful device, contrary to the plain rules of
common honesty</i>.</p>

<p>The Statute of the 33d of Henry the Eighth, <i>cap.</i> 1. entered into a
more specific explanation of what might constitute such an offence,
and fixed the mode of punishment; by declaring, "<i>that if any persons
shall falsely or deceitfully obtain, or get into his hands or
possession, any money, goods, &amp;c. of any other person</i>, by colour or
means of any false privy token, or counterfeit letter, <i>&amp;c.&mdash;he shall,
on conviction, be punished by imprisonment, the pillory, or
whipping&mdash;saving to the party aggrieved the same power of recovering
the property as he might have had at Common Law, &amp;c.</i>"</p>

<p>From this remote period, until the 30th of George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">-114-</a></span> the Second, the
Legislature does not appear to have seen the necessity of enacting any
new Law, applicable to this species of offence.</p>

<p>In the progress however of Society and Commerce, joined to the
consequent influx of riches, producing luxury and extravagance, a
larger field opened for cheats and sharpers of every description;
insomuch, that the evil became so great, and the existing Laws were
found so insufficient, as to render it necessary to provide a
legislative remedy.</p>

<p>In applying this remedy, it seems that the great increase of a new
species of cheating, practised by persons known in modern times by the
name of <i>Swindlers</i>, had suggested the propriety of defining the
offence, in a more applicable and specific manner, and of rendering
the punishment more severe. By the act of 30 Geo. II. <i>cap.</i> 24. it is
declared, "<i>that all persons obtaining money, goods, wares, or
merchandise</i>, by false pretences, <i>shall be deemed offenders against
the Law and the public peace; and the Court, before whom any such
offender shall be tried, shall on conviction, order them to be put in
the pillory, or publicly whipped, or transported for seven years</i>."</p>

<p>Thus stand the Laws at present with regard to Swindlers.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> They
ought certainly to embrace a wider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">-115-</a></span> field, so as to reach those
artifices by which sharpers and persons of depraved minds, obtain
money from the ignorant and unwary, by assuming false characters,
taking genteel lodgings, and cheating innocent tradesmen, who lose
large sums annually by such depredations.</p>

<p>We shall next proceed to particularize the various classes of Sharpers
who thus prey upon the public: reserving all that relates to those
more immediately connected with <i>Gaming Houses</i> and <i>Lottery
Insurances</i> to the <a href="#CHAP_VI">subsequent chapter</a>.</p>

<p>I. <i>Sharpers who obtain Licences to become Pawnbrokers</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and bring
disgrace upon the reputable part of the trade, by every species of
fraud which can add to the distresses of those who are compelled to
raise money in this way; for which purpose there are abundance of
opportunities.&mdash;Swindling Pawnbrokers, of this Class, are uniformly
receivers of stolen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">-116-</a></span> goods; and under the cover of their licence do
much mischief to the Public. The evil arising from them might, in a
great measure, be prevented by placing the power of granting licences
in a general Board of Police; and rendering it necessary for all
persons to produce a Certificate of character, before they can obtain
such licence; and also to enter into recognizance for good
behaviour.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>II. <i>Sharpers and Swindlers who obtain Licences to be Hawkers and
Pedlars</i>; under the cover of which every species of villainy is
practised upon the country people, as well as upon the unwary in the
Metropolis, and all the great towns in the kingdom.&mdash;The artifices by
which they succeed, are various, as for example;&mdash;By fraudulent
raffles, where plated goods are exhibited as silver, and where the
chances are exceedingly against the adventurers;&mdash;By selling and
uttering base money, and frequently forged Bank Notes, which make one
of the most profitable branches of their trade;&mdash;By dealing in
smuggled goods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">-117-</a></span> thereby promoting the sale of articles injurious to
the Revenue, besides cheating the ignorant with regard to the
value;&mdash;By receiving stolen goods to be disposed of in the country, by
which discoveries are prevented, and assistance afforded to common
thieves and stationary receivers;&mdash;By purchasing stolen horses in one
part of the country, and disposing of them in another, in the course
of their journies; in accomplishing which, so as to elude detection,
they have great opportunities;&mdash;By gambling with EO Tables at Fairs
and Horse-races.</p>

<p>A number of other devices might be pointed out, which render this
class of men great nuisances in Society; and shew the necessity of
either suppressing them totally, (for in fact they are of little use
to the Public;) or of limiting the licences only to men of good
character; to be granted by a general Board of Police under whose
controul they should be placed, while they enter at the same time into
a recognizance in a certain sum, with one surety for good behaviour;
by which the honest part would be retained, to the exclusion of the
fraudulent.</p>

<p>III. <i>Swindlers who take out Licences as Auctioneers</i>, and open shops
in different parts of the Metropolis, with persons at the doors,
usually denominated <i>Barkers</i>, inviting strangers to walk in. In these
places, various articles of silver plate and household goods are
exposed to sale, made up on a slight principle, and of little
intrinsic value; associates, generally denominated <i>Puffers</i>, are in
waiting to bid up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">-118-</a></span> the article to a sum greatly beyond its value,
when, upon the first bidding of the stranger, it is knocked down to
him, and the money instantly demanded; the goods, however, on being
carried home and examined, are generally found to be very different in
reality, from what their appearance exhibited, and upon a close
examination the fraud is discovered.</p>

<p>Neither the common Law, nor the Act of the 30th George II. cap. 24,
seem to be sufficiently <i>broad</i> and explanatory to include this
species of offence; and hence it is, that this mode of selling goods
continues with impunity, and seems to increase. It is not, however,
meant here to insinuate that all petty auctions are fraudulent.&mdash;It is
to be hoped there may be some exceptions, although probably, they are
not numerous. A licence from a general Board of Police, and to be
subject to certain restrictions only burdensome to the dishonest, and
obliging the parties to find security, would, in a great measure,
regulate this kind of business, in a proper manner.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Swindlers who raise money, by pretending to be Discounters of
Bills, and Money Brokers</i>; These chiefly prey upon young men of
property, who have lost their money at play, or spent it in expensive
amusements, and are obliged to raise more upon any terms, until their
rents or incomes become payable; or who have fortunes in prospect, as
being heirs apparent to estates, but who require assistance in the
mean time.</p>

<p>Availing themselves of the credit, or the ultimate responsibility, of
such thoughtless and giddy young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">-119-</a></span> men, in the eager pursuit of
criminal pleasures, and under the influence of those allurements which
the Faro Tables, and other places of fashionable resort hold
out&mdash;these Swindlers seldom fail to obtain from them securities and
obligations for large sums; upon the credit of which they are enabled,
perhaps, at usurious interest, to borrow money, or discount bills; and
thus supply their unfortunate customers upon the most extravagant
terms.</p>

<p>Another class, having some capital, advance money upon bonds,
title-deeds, and other specialities, or upon the bond of the parties
having estates in reversion: by these and other devices too tedious to
detail, large sums of money are, most unwarrantably and illegally,
wrested from the dissipated and thoughtless: and misery and distress
are thus entailed upon them, as long as they live; or they are driven,
by utter ruin, to acts of desperation or to crimes.</p>

<p>A Law seems absolutely necessary to be pointed at this particular
mischief, which is certainly an increasing evil.&mdash;Humanity pleads for
it; and <i>Policy</i> points out the necessity of some effectual guard
against those miseries which it generates; and which could not exist
in so great a degree, were it not for the opportunities held out by
these blood-suckers, in affording money to the young and
inexperienced, to be expended in scenes of gambling and debauchery.</p>

<p>V. <i>A Class of Cheats of the Society of Jews, who are to be found in
every street, lane and alley in and near the Metropolis, under the
pretence of purchasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">-120-</a></span> old clothes, and metals of different sorts</i>;
Their chief business really is to prowl about the houses and stables
of men of rank and fortune, for the purpose of holding out temptations
to the servants to pilfer and steal small articles, not likely to be
missed, which these Jews purchase at about one third of the real
value.&mdash;It is supposed that upwards of fifteen hundred of these
depraved people are employed in diurnal journies of this kind; by
which, through the medium of bad money, and other fraudulent dealings,
many of them acquire property, and then set up shops and become
Receivers of stolen Goods.</p>

<p>It is estimated that there are from fifteen to twenty thousand Jews in
the city of London, besides, perhaps, about five or six thousand more
in the great provincial and sea-port towns; (where there are at least
twenty synagogues, besides six in the Metropolis;) most of the lower
classes of those distinguished by the name of German or Dutch Jews,
live chiefly by their wits, and establish a system of mischievous
intercourse all over the country, the better to carry on their
fraudulent designs in the circulation of base money,&mdash;the sale of
stolen goods, and in the purchase of metals of various kinds; as well
as other articles pilfered from the Dock-Yards, and stolen in the
provincial towns, which they bring to the Metropolis to elude
detection,&mdash;and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>Educated in idleness from their earliest infancy, they acquire every
debauched and vicious principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">-121-</a></span> which can fit them for the most
complicated arts of fraud and deception; to which they seldom fail to
add the crime of perjury, whenever it can be of use, in shielding
themselves or their associates from the punishment of the law.&mdash;From
the orange boy, and the retailer of seals, razors, glass, and other
wares, in the public streets, to the shop-keeper, dealer in wearing
apparel, or in silver and gold, the same principles of conduct too
generally prevail.</p>

<p>The itinerants utter base money to enable them, by selling cheap, to
dispose of their goods; while those that are stationary, with very few
exceptions, receive and purchase, at an under-price, whatever is
brought them, without asking questions.</p>

<p>VI. <i>Cheats who sell provisions and other articles by means of false
weights and measures.</i> Nothing requires the assistance of the
Legislature in a greater degree than this evil; to shield the Poor
against the numerous tricks thus practised upon them, by low and
inferior shop-keepers and itinerants.</p>

<p>The ancient System of regulating this useful branch of Police by the
Juries of the Court-Leet, having been found ineffectual, and in many
respects inapplicable to the present state of Society, an act passed
the 35th of his present Majesty, (<i>cap.</i> 102,) to remedy the
inconvenience with regard to fraudulent weights; but difficulties
having occurred on account of the expence of carrying it into
execution, certain amendments were made by another act, (37 Geo. III.
<i>c.</i> 143,) and the Magistrates in Petty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">-122-</a></span> Sessions have now power to
appoint Examiners of weights, and to authorize them to visit shops,
seize false weights, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This plan, if pursued as steadily as that which already prevails in
regulating Bakers, promises to produce very valuable benefits to the
lower ranks of people at a very small expence.</p>

<p>VII. <i>Cheats and Swindlers who associate together, and enter into a
conspiracy for the purpose of defrauding Tradesmen of their
goods.</i>&mdash;One of these sharpers generally assumes the character of a
Merchant;&mdash;hires a genteel house, with a counting-house, and every
appearance of business.&mdash;One or two associates take upon them the
appearance of Clerks, while others occasionally wear a livery: and
sometimes a carriage is set up, in which the ladies of the party visit
the shops, in the stile of persons of fashion, ordering goods to their
apartments.&mdash;Thus circumstanced, goods are obtained on credit, which
are immediately pawned or sold, and the produce used as a means of
deception to obtain more, and procure recommendations, by offering to
pay ready money,&mdash;or discount bills.</p>

<p>When confidence is once established in this way, notes and bills are
fabricated by these conspirators, as if remitted from the country, or
from foreign parts; and application is made to their newly acquired
friends, the tradesmen, to assist in discounting them. Sometimes money
and bills upon one another are lodged at the bankers for the purpose
of extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">-123-</a></span> their credit, by referring to some respectable name for
a character.</p>

<p>After circulating notes to a considerable amount, and completing their
system of fraud by possessing as much of the property of others as is
possible, without risk of detection, they move off; assume new
characters; and when the bills and notes are due, the parties are not
to be found.</p>

<p>Offences of this sort, where an actual conspiracy cannot be proved,
which is generally very difficult, are not easily punished; and it
seems of importance that frauds and impositions of this sort, and
others of the same nature, where the confidence of tradesmen and
manufacturers is abused by misrepresentation and falsehood, should be
defined, so as to render it difficult for the parties to escape
punishment.</p>

<p>VIII. <i>Cheats who take genteel Lodgings, dress elegantly, assume false
names</i>:&mdash;pretend to be related to persons of credit and
fashion&mdash;produce letters familiarly written to prove an
intimacy,&mdash;enter into conversation, and shew these letters to
tradesmen and others, upon whom they have a design&mdash;get into their
good graces, purchase wearing apparel and other articles, and
disappear with the booty.</p>

<p>This species of offence would be very difficult to reach by any
existing Law, and yet it is practised in various shapes in the
Metropolis, whereby tradesmen are defrauded to a very considerable
extent.&mdash;Some legislative guards would certainly be very desirable to
define and punish these offences also.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">-124-</a></span></p>

<p>IX. <i>Cheats, who have been formerly in the service of Milliners,
Mantua-Makers, Taylors, and other Traders, who have occasion to send
to shop-keepers and warehousemen for goods</i>;&mdash;These, after being
discharged from their service, getting into the company of sharpers
and thieves, while out of place, teach them how to personate their
former employers; in whose names they too frequently succeed in
obtaining considerable quantities of goods before the fraud is
discovered.</p>

<p>It would certainly be a good rule at no time to deliver goods upon a
verbal message; and it would be useful if all persons discharging
servants, would give notice of it to every tradesmen with whom they
deal.</p>

<p>X. <i>Cheats who personate Gentlemen's footmen</i>; These order goods to be
sent to a genteel lodging, where the associate is waiting, who draws
upon some banker in a distant part of the town for the money; or, if
the check is refused, a country bank-note (the gentleman just being
arrived in town) is offered to be changed, which, although a forgery,
often succeeds: if this should also fail, this mischievous class of
people, from habit and close attention to the means of deception, are
seldom at a loss in finding out some other expedient; and before the
fraud is discovered, the parties are off; and the master transformed
into the livery-servant, to practise in his turn the same trick upon
some other person.</p>

<p>XI. <i>Cheats who associate systematically together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">-125-</a></span> for the purpose of
finding out and making a prey of every person from the country, or any
ignorant person who is supposed to have money, or who has come to
London for the purpose of selling goods.</i>&mdash;It is usual in such cases
for one of them to assume the character of a young 'Squire, just come
to his estate; to appear careless and prodigal, and to shew handfuls
of bank-notes, all of which are false and fabricated for the purpose.</p>

<p>Another personates the guardian of the 'Squire, while a part of the
associates pretend to sit down to play, and having won money of the
young spendthrift, who appears extremely ignorant and profuse, the
stranger's avarice gets the better of his prudence, and he is induced
at length to try his luck,&mdash;the result is that he is soon left without
a penny.</p>

<p>XII. <i>Cheats who prowl about in all the streets and lanes of the
trading part of the Metropolis, where shopmen and boys are carrying
parcels</i>: These, by means of various stratagems, find out where the
parcels are going, and regulating their measures accordingly, seldom
fail by some trick or other, (such as giving the lad a shilling to run
and call a coach,) to get hold of the property.&mdash;Porters and young men
from the country should be particularly cautious never to quit any
property intrusted to their care, until delivered (not at the door)
but within the house to which it is directed.</p>

<p>XIII. <i>Cheats who attend Inns, at the time that coaches and waggons
are loading or unloading.</i> These by personating <i>porters</i> with aprons
and knots, or <i>clerks</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">-126-</a></span> with pens stuck in their wigs or hair, and by
having recourse to a variety of stratagems, according to the peculiar
circumstances of the case, aided by their having previously noticed
the address of several of the parcels, seldom fail of success, in the
general hurry and confusion which prevails at such places. This proves
how necessary it is at all times to have one or two intelligent
officers of justice, who know the faces of thieves, in attendance,
while goods are receiving and delivering.</p>

<p>XIV. <i>Cheats who go from door to door collecting money; under pretence
of soliciting for a charitable establishment</i>, for the benefit of poor
children, and other purposes. But the money, instead of being so
applied, is generally spent in eating and drinking; and the most
infamous imposition is thus practised upon the charitable and humane,
who are the dupes of this species of fraud in too many instances.</p>

<p>XV. <i>Sharpers who are known by the name of Duffers.</i> These go about
from house to house, and attend public houses, inns, and fairs,
pretending to sell smuggled goods, such as India handkerchiefs,
waistcoat patterns, muslins, &amp;c. By offering their goods for sale,
they are enabled to discover the proper objects, who may be
successfully practised upon in various ways; and if they do not
succeed in promoting some gambling scheme, by which the party is
plundered of his money, they seldom fail passing forged country bank
notes, or base silver and copper in the course of their dealings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">-127-</a></span></p>

<p>XVI. <i>Female Sharpers who dress elegantly, personate women of fashion,
attend masquerades, and even go to St. James's.</i> These, from their
effrontery, actually get into the circle; where their wits and hands
are employed in obtaining diamonds, and whatever other articles of
value, capable of being concealed, are found to be most accessible.</p>

<p>The wife of a well-known sharper, lately upon the town, is said to
have appeared at Court, dressed in a stile of peculiar elegance: while
the sharper himself is supposed to have gone in the dress of a
clergyman.&mdash;According to the information of a noted receiver, they
pilfered to the value of £1700. on the King's birth-day (1795,)
without discovery or suspicion.</p>

<p>Houses are kept where female Cheats dress and undress for public
places.&mdash;Thirty or forty of these sharpers generally attend all
masquerades, in different characters, where they seldom fail to get
clear off with a considerable booty.</p>

<p>XVII. <i>Among the classes of Cheats may be ranked a species of Female
Bankers.</i> These accommodate barrow-women and others, who sell fish,
fruit, vegetables, &amp;c. in the streets, with five shillings a day; (the
usual diurnal stock in trade in such cases;) for the use of which, for
twelve hours, they obtain a premium of <i>six-pence</i>, when the money is
returned in the evening, receiving thereby at this rate, about <i>seven
pounds ten shillings a year</i> for every five shillings they lend out!</p>

<p>The Author, in the course of his Magisterial duty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">-128-</a></span> having discovered
this extraordinary species of fraud, attempted to explain to a
barrow-woman on whom it was practised, that by saving up a single
<i>five shillings</i>, and not laying any part of it out in gin, but
keeping the whole, she would save £7. 10<i>s.</i> a year, which seemed to
astonish her, and to stagger her belief.&mdash;It is to be feared, however,
that it had no effect upon her future conduct, since it is evident
that this improvident and dissolute class of females have no other
idea than that of making the day and the way alike long.&mdash;Their
profits (which are often considerably augmented by dealing in base
money, as well as fruit, vegetables, &amp;c.) seldom last over the day,
for they never fail to have a luxurious dinner and a hot supper, with
abundance of gin and porter:&mdash;looking in general no farther than to
keep whole the original stock, with the <i>six-pence</i> interest, which is
paid over to the female banker in the evening; and a new loan obtained
on the following morning, of the same number of shillings again to go
to market.</p>

<p>In contemplating this curious system of Banking, (trifling as it seems
to be) it is impossible not to be forcibly struck with the immense
profits that arise from it. It is only necessary for one of these
female sharpers to possess a capital of <i>seventy shillings</i>, or three
pounds ten shillings, with fourteen steady and regular customers, in
order to realize an income of <span class="smcap">one hundred guineas</span> a year!</p>

<p>XVIII. <i>Cheats who pretend to tell fortunes.</i> These impose on the
credulity of the public, by advertise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">-129-</a></span>ments and cards; pretending a
power, from their knowledge of astrology, to foretell future events,
to discover stolen property, lucky numbers in the Lottery, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The extent to which this mischief goes in the Metropolis is almost
beyond belief; particularly during the drawing of the Lottery.&mdash;The
folly and phrenzy which prevail in vulgar life, lead ignorant and
deluded people into the snare of adding to the misfortunes which the
Lottery occasions, by additional advances of money (obtained generally
by pawning goods or apparel) paid to pretended astrologers for
suggesting <i>lucky numbers</i>, upon which they are advised to make
insurances; and under the influence of this unaccountable delusion,
they are too often induced to increase their risks, and ruin their
families.</p>

<p>One of these impostors who lived long in the Curtain-Road, Shoreditch,
is said, in conjunction with his associates, to have made near £300. a
year by practising upon the credulity of the lower orders of the
people.&mdash;He stiled himself (in his circulating cards) an <i>Astronomer
and Astrologer</i>; and stated, <i>That he gave advice to Gentlemen and
Ladies on business, trade, contracts, removals, journies by land or
water, marriages, children, law-suits, absent friends, &amp;c.</i> And
further, that <i>he calculated nativities accurately</i>,&mdash;His fee was
half-a-crown.</p>

<p>An instance of mischievous credulity, occasioned by consulting this
impostor, once fell under the re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">-130-</a></span>view of the Author. A person having
property stolen from him, went to consult the conjuror respecting the
thief; who having described something like the person of a man whom he
suspected, his credulity and folly so far got the better of his reason
and reflection, as to induce him upon the authority of this impostor
<i>actually to charge his neighbour with a felony</i>, and to cause him to
be apprehended. The Magistrate settled the matter by discharging the
prisoner; reprimanding the accuser severely, and ordering the conjuror
to be taken into custody, according to law, <i>as a Rogue and Vagabond</i>.</p>

<p>But the delusion with regard to Fortune-tellers is not confined to
vulgar life, since it is known, that ladies of rank, fashion, and
fortune, contribute to the encouragement of this fraudulent profession
in particular, by their visits to a pretended Astrologer of their own
sex in the neighbourhood of Tottenham-Court Road: This woman, to the
disgrace of her votaries, whose education ought to have taught them
the folly and weakness of countenancing such gross impositions, found
the practice of it extremely productive.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The act of the 9th George the Second, <i>cap.</i> 5, <i>punishes all persons
pretending skill in any crafty science; or telling fortunes, or where
stolen goods may be found;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">-131-</a></span> with a year's imprisonment, and standing
four times in the pillory</i> (once every quarter) <i>during the term of
such imprisonment. The act called the Vagrant Act, made the 17th year
of the same reign, (cap. 5,) declares such persons to be rogues and
vagabonds, and liable to be punished as such.</i></p>

<p>It is sincerely to be hoped that those at least who are convinced from
having suffered by the gross imposition practised upon the credulity
of the people by these pests of Society, will enable the civil
Magistrate, by proper informations, to suppress so great an evil.</p>

<p>Innumerable almost are the other tricks and devices which are resorted
to by the horde of Cheats, Swindlers, and Sharpers, who infest the
Metropolis.</p>

<p>The great increase of commerce, and the confidence resulting from an
intercourse so wide and extended, frequently lays men of property and
tradesmen open to a variety of frauds; credit is obtained by
subterfuges and devices contrary to the plain rules of common honesty,
against which, however, there is no remedy but by an action of common
law.</p>

<p>If it were possible to look accurately at the different evils arising
from fraudulent and swindling practices, so as to frame a statute that
would generally reach all the cases that occur, whenever the barrier
of common honesty is broken down, it would certainly be productive of
infinite benefit to the community; for, in spite of the laudable
exertions of the Society established for prosecuting swindlers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">-132-</a></span> it is
to be lamented that the evil has not diminished. On the contrary, it
has certainly encreased, and must continue to do so, until the
Legislature, by applicable Laws and an improved System of Police,
either directly or collaterally attaching to these offences, shall
find the means of suppressing them.</p>

<p><span class="cap">G</span>AMING is the source from which has sprung up all that race of cheats,
swindlers, and sharpers, some of whose nefarious practices have
already been noticed, and the remainder of which it is the object of
the Author to develope in this chapter.</p>

<p>Such has been the anxiety of the Legislature to suppress this evil,
that so early as the reign of Queen Anne, this abandoned and
mischievous race of men seems to have attracted its notice in a very
particular degree; for the act of the 9th year of that reign (cap. 14.
§§ 6, 7,) after reciting, "<i>that divers lewd and dissolute persons
live at great expences, having no visible estate, profession, or
calling, to maintain themselves; but support these expences by Gaming
only</i>; Enacts, <i>that any two Justices may cause to be brought before
them, all persons within their limits whom they shall have just cause
to suspect to have no visible estate, profession, or calling, to
maintain themselves by; but do for the most part support themselves by
Gaming; and if such persons shall not make it appear to such Justices
that the principal part of their expences is not maintained by gaming,
they are to be bound to their good behaviour for a twelve-month; and
in default of sufficient security, to be committed to prison, until
they can find the same; and if security shall be given, it will be
forfeited on their playing or betting at any one time, for more than
the value of twenty shillings</i>."</p>

<p>If, in conformity to the <i>spirit</i> of this wise statute,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">-135-</a></span> sharpers of
every denomination, who support themselves by a variety of cheating
and swindling practices, without having any visible means of living,
were in like manner to be called upon to find security for their good
behaviour, in all cases where they cannot shew they have the means of
subsisting themselves honestly, the number of these Pests of Society,
under a general Police and an active and zealous Magistracy, would
soon be diminished, if not totally annihilated.</p>

<p>By the 12th of George the Second, (cap. 28. § 2, 3,) "<i>the Games of
Faro, Hazard, &amp;c. are declared to be Lotteries, subjecting the persons
who keep them to a penalty of two hundred pounds, and those who play
to fifty pounds</i>."&mdash;<i>One</i> witness only is necessary to prove the
offence before any Justice of the Peace; <i>and the Justice forfeits ten
pounds if he neglects to do his duty under the Act</i>:&mdash;and under this
Act, which is connected with the statute 8th of George I. cap. 2, it
seems that "<i>the keeper of a Faro Table may be prosecuted even for a
penalty of five hundred pounds</i>."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these salutary laws, to the reproach of the Police of
the Metropolis, houses have been opened, even under the sanction of
high-sounding names, where an indiscriminate mixture of all ranks was
to be found, from the <i>finished sharper</i> to the <i>raw inexperienced
youth</i>. And where all those evils existed in full force, which it was
the object of the Legislature to remove.</p>

<p>Though it is hoped that this iniquitous System of plunder, has of late
been somewhat restrained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">-136-</a></span> the wholesome administration of the Laws,
under the excellent Chief Justice who presides in the High Criminal
Department of the Country, in consequence of the detection of
Criminals, through the meritorious vigilance and attention of the
Magistrates; to which the Author of this work, by bringing the evil so
prominently under the view of the Public, may flatter himself in
having been in some small degree instrumental: Still it is much to be
feared, that the time is not yet arrived which would induce him to
withhold the following narrative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gaming</span>, although at all times an object highly deserving attention,
and calling for the exertions of Magistrates, never appeared either to
have assumed so alarming an aspect, or to have been conducted upon the
methodized system of <i>Partnership-Concerns</i>, wherein pecuniary
capitals were embarked, till about the years 1777 and 1778, when the
vast licence which was given to those abominable engines of fraud, EO
Tables, and the great length of time which elapsed before a check was
given to them by the Police, afforded a number of dissolute and
abandoned characters, who resorted to these baneful subterfuges for
support, an opportunity of acquiring property: This was afterwards
increased in low Gaming Houses, and by following up the same system at
Newmarket, and other places of fashionable resort, and in the Lottery;
until at length, without any property at the outset, or any visible
means of lawful support, a sum of money, little short of <i>One Million
Sterling</i>, is said to have been acquired by a class of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">-137-</a></span> individuals
originally (with some few exceptions) of the lowest and most depraved
order of Society. This enormous mass of wealth (acquired no doubt by
entailing misery on many worthy and respectable Families, and driving
the unhappy victims to acts of desperation and suicide,) is said to
have been afterwards engaged as a great and an efficient capital for
carrying on various illegal Establishments; particularly
Gaming-Houses, and Shops for fraudulent Insurances in the Lottery;
together with such objects of dissipation as the Races at Newmarket
and other places of <i>fashionable</i> resort, held out: all which were
employed as the means of increasing and improving the ill-gotten
wealth of the parties engaged in these nefarious pursuits.</p>

<p>A System, grown to such an enormous height, had, of course, its rise
by progressive advances. Several of those who now roll in their gaudy
carriages, and associate with some men of high rank and fashion, may
be found upon the Registers of the Old Bailey; or traced to the
vagrant pursuit of turning, with their own hands, EO Tables in the
open streets; These mischievous Members of Society, through the wealth
obtained by a course of procedure diametrically opposite to Law, are,
by a strange perversion, sheltered from the operation of that Justice,
which every act of their lives has offended: they bask in the
sun-shine of prosperity; while thousands, who owe their distress and
ruin to the horrid designs thus <i>executed</i>, <i>invigorated</i> and
<i>extended</i>, are pining in misery and want.</p>

<p>Certain it is, that the mischiefs arising from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">-138-</a></span> rapid increase,
and from the vast extent of capital employed in these Systems of ruin
and depravity, have become great and alarming beyond calculation; as
will be evinced by developing the nature of the very dangerous
Confederacy which systematically moves and directs this vast Machine
of destruction&mdash;composed in general of men who have been reared and
educated under the influence of every species of depravity which can
debase the human character.</p>

<p>Wherever Interest or resentment suggests to their minds a line of
conduct calculated to gratify any base or illegal propensity; it is
immediately indulged. Some are taken into this iniquitous Partnership
for their dexterity in securing the dice; or in dealing cards at
Faro.&mdash;Informers are apprehended and imprisoned upon writs, obtained,
by perjury, to deter others from similar attacks. Witnesses are
suborned&mdash;officers of justice are bribed, wherever it can be done, by
large sums of money<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>&mdash;ruffians and blud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">-139-</a></span>geon-men are employed to
resist the Civil Power, where pecuniary gratuities fail&mdash;and houses
are barricadoed and guarded by armed men: thereby offering defiance to
the common exertions of the Laws, and opposing the regular authority
of Magistrates.</p>

<p>It is impossible to contemplate a Confederacy thus circumstanced, so
powerful from its immense pecuniary resources, and so mischievous and
oppressive from the depravity which directs these resources, without
feeling an anxiety to see the strong arm of the Law still further and
unremittingly exerted for the purpose of effectually destroying it.</p>

<p>Whilst one part of the immense property by which this confederacy was
so strongly fortified was employed in the establishment of
<i>Gaming-Houses</i>, holding out the most fascinating allurements to giddy
young <i>men of fortune</i>, and others, having access to money, by means
of splendid entertainments,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and regular suppers, with abundance of
the choicest wines, so as to form a genteel lounge for the dissipated
and unwary; another part of the capital was said to form the stock
which composes the various Faro-Banks which were to be found at the
routes of <i>Ladies of Fashion</i>: Thus drawing into this vortex of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">-140-</a></span>
iniquity and ruin, not only the <i>males</i>, but also the <i>females</i> of the
thoughtless and opulent part of Society; who too easily became a prey
to that idle vanity which frequently overpowers reason and reflection;
and the delusion of which is seldom terminated till it is too late.</p>

<p>Evil example, when thus sanctioned by apparent respectability, and by
the dazzling blandishment of rank and fashion, is so intoxicating to
those who have either suddenly acquired riches, or who are young and
inexperienced, that it almost ceases to be a matter of wonder that the
fatal propensity to Gaming should become universal; extending itself
over all ranks in Society in a degree scarcely to be credited, but by
those who will attentively investigate the subject.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the troubles in France, and before this Country
was visited by the hordes of Emigrants of all descriptions, who fixed
a temporary or permanent residence in this Metropolis, the number of
Gaming-Houses (exclusive of those that are select, and have long been
established by Subscription,) did not exceed above <i>four</i> or <i>five</i>:
In the year 1797, not less than <i>thirty</i> were said to be actually
open; where, besides <i>Faro</i> and <i>Hazard</i>, the foreign games of
<i>Roulet</i>, and <i>Rouge et Noir</i>, were introduced, and where there
existed a regular gradation of establishment, accommodating to all
ranks; from the man of fashion, down to the thief, the burglar, and
the pick-pocket&mdash;where immense sums of money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">-141-</a></span> were played for every
evening, for eight months in the year.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>In a commercial Country, and in a great Metropolis, where from the
vast extent of its trade and manufactures, and from the periodical
issue of above Twenty Millions annually, arising from dividends on
funded security, there must be an immense circulation of property, the
danger is not to be conceived, from the allurements which are thus
held out to young men in business, having the command of money, as
well as to the clerks of merchants, bankers, and others concerned in
different branches of trade: In fact, it is well known, that too many
of this class resort at present to these destructive scenes of vice,
idleness, and misfortune.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">-142-</a></span></p>
<p>The mind shrinks with horror at the existence of a System in the
Metropolis, unknown to our ancestors, even in the worst periods of
their dissipation; when a <i>Ward</i>, a <i>Waters</i>, and a <i>Chartres</i>,
insulted public morals by their vices and their crimes: for then no
regular Establishments&mdash;no systematic concerns for carrying on this
nefarious trade, were known.&mdash;No Partnerships in Gaming-Houses, were
conducted with the regularity of Commercial Houses.</p>

<p>But these Partnerships have not been confined to Gaming-Houses alone.
A considerable proportion of the immense capital which the conductors
of the System possess, is employed periodically in the <i>two
Lotteries</i>, in <i>Fraudulent Insurances</i>, where, like the Faro Bank, the
chances are so calculated as to yield about 30 per cent. profit to the
Gambling proprietors; and from the extent to which these transactions
have been, and we fear still are carried, no doubt can be entertained
that the annual gains must be immense.&mdash;It has, indeed, been stated,
with an appearance of truth, that a single individual acquired no less
than £.60,000 during one English Lottery!</p>

<p>Although it is impossible to be perfectly accurate in any estimate
which can be formed; for in this, as in all other cases where
calculations are introduced in this Work, accuracy to a point is not
to be expected; yet when all circumstances are considered, there
ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">-143-</a></span>pear just grounds to suppose that the following Statement, placing
the whole in one connected point of view, may convey to the Reader no
very imperfect idea of the vast and unparalleled extent to which this
horrid mischief had arrived; and to which, if not closely watched, it
may yet rise once more.</p>

<p>This aggregate is only to be considered as shewing the mere
interchange of property from one hand to another; yet when it is
recollected that the operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">-144-</a></span> must progressively produce a certain
loss, with not many exceptions, to all the innocent and unsuspecting
adventurers either at Pharo or the Lottery, with an almost uniform
gain to the proprietors; the result is shocking to reflect upon.&mdash;To
individual families in easy circumstances where this unfortunate mania
prevails, as well as to the mass of the people who are fascinated by
the delusion of the Lottery Insurances, it is the worst of all
misfortunes.&mdash;By seizing every opportunity to take advantage of this
unhappy bias, it is no uncommon thing to see the pennyless miscreant
of to-day become the opulent gambler of to-morrow: leaving the unhappy
sufferers often no alternative but exile, beggary, or a prison; or
perhaps, rendered desperate by reflecting on the folly of their
conduct, to end their days by suicide,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> while wives, children, and
dependants are suddenly reduced from affluence to the lowest abyss of
misery.</p>

<p>In contemplating these vast establishments of regular and systematic
fraud and depredation upon the Public, in all the hideous forms which
they assume, nothing is so much to be lamented as the unconquerable
spirit which draws such a multitude of the lower ranks of Society into
the vortex of the Lottery.</p>

<p>The agents in this iniquitous System, availing themselves of the
existence of the delusion, spare no pains to keep it alive; so that
the evil extends far and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">-145-</a></span> wide, and the mischiefs, distresses, and
calamities resulting from it, were it possible to detail them, would
form a catalogue of sufferings of which the opulent and luxurious have
no conception.</p>

<p>Of how much importance therefore is it to the Public at large, to see
these evils suppressed; and above all, to have this novel System
completely annihilated, by which Gambling Establishments have been
formed upon commercial principles of methodical arrangements, with
vast capitals employed for the most infamous and diabolical purposes.</p>

<p>Let those who have acquired wealth in this way be satisfied with what
they have gotten, and with the misery their gains have occasioned to
ruined thousands: let them abstain from employing it in channels
calculated to extend these evils. The Law is generally slow in its
operations: but it seldom fails to overtake the guilty at last.</p>

<p>To this Confederacy, powerful in wealth, and unrestrained by those
considerations of moral rectitude, which govern the conduct of other
men engaged in the common pursuits of life, is to be attributed those
vast additional hazards to which the young and inexperienced have been
subjected&mdash;Hazards, which not only did not exist before these
establishments were matured and moulded into System; but which were
considerably increased, from its becoming a part of the general
arrangements to employ men of genteel exterior, (and it is to be
feared too, in many instances of good connections) who, having been
ruined by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">-146-</a></span> delusion, descended as a means of subsistence, to
accept the degrading office of seeking out those customers, whose
access to money rendered them proper objects to be ensnared.&mdash;For such
was the nature of this new System of destruction, that while a young
man entering upon life, conceived himself honoured by the friendship
and acquaintance of those who were considered to be men of fashion,
and of good connections, he was deluded by splendid entertainments
into the snare, which afterwards robbed him of his property and peace
of mind.</p>

<p>Such were the arrangements of this alarming and mischievous
Confederacy, for the purpose of plundering the thoughtless and
unwary.&mdash;The evidence given in the Court of King's Bench, in an
action, tried for Gaming, on the 29th November, 1796, served pretty
fully to develope the shocking System of fraud pursued, after the
inexperienced and unwary were entrapped into these receptacles of ruin
and destruction.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">-147-</a></span></p>
<p>While a vice, ruinous to the morals and to the fortunes of the younger
part of the Community who move in the middle and higher ranks of life
is suffered to be pursued in direct opposition to <i>positive
statutes</i>,&mdash;surely, blame must attach somewhere!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">-148-</a></span></p>

<p>The idle vanity of being introduced into what is generally, but
erroneously, termed genteel society, where a fashionable name
announces an intention of seeing company, has been productive of more
<i>domestic misery</i> and more <i>real distress</i>, <i>poverty</i>, and
<i>wretchedness</i> to <i>families</i> in this great City (who but for their
folly might have been easy and comfortable,) than many volumes could
detail.</p>

<p>A mistaken sense of what constitutes human happiness, fatally leads
the mass of the People who have the means of moving in any degree
above the middle ranks of life, into circles where Faro Tables and
other games at hazard are introduced in private families:&mdash;Where the
least recommendation (and Sharpers spare no pains to obtain
recommendations) is a passport to all who can exhibit a genteel
exterior; and where the young and the inexperienced are initiated in
every propensity tending to debase human character; while they are
taught to view with contempt every acquirement, connected with the
duties which lead to domestic happiness, or to those qualifications
which can render either sex respectable in the world.</p>

<p>When such infamous practices are encouraged and sanctioned by
high-sounding names,&mdash;when sharpers and black-legs find an easy
introduction into the houses of persons of fashion, who assemble in
multitudes together, for the purpose of playing at those most odious
and detestable games of hazard, which the Legislature has stigmatised
with such marks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">-149-</a></span> reprobation, it is time for the Civil Magistrate
to step forward:&mdash;It is time for him to feel, that, in doing that duty
which the Laws of his Country impose on him, he is perhaps saving
hundreds of families from ruin and destruction; and preserving to the
infants of thoughtless and deluded parents that property which is
their birth-right: but which, for want of an energetic Police in
enforcing the Laws made for their protection, is now too frequently
squandered; and the mind is tortured with the sad reflection, that
with the loss of fortune, all opportunities (in consequence of idle
habits) are also lost, of fitting the unfortunate sufferer for any
reputable pursuit in life, by which an honest livelihood could be
obtained.</p>

<p>In this situation, the transition from the plain gamester to the
fraudulent one, and from that to every other species of criminality,
is easily conceived: and it is by no means an unfair conclusion, that
this has been the fate of not a few who have been early introduced
into these haunts of idleness and vice; and who, but for such an
education, might have become useful members of the State.</p>

<p>The accumulated evils, arising from this source, are said to have been
suffered to continue, from a prevailing idea, that Persons of Rank and
their immediate associates were beyond the reach of being controlled,
by laws made for the mass of the People; and that nothing but capital
offences could attach to persons of this condition in life.</p>

<p>If these evils were, in fact, merely confined to Per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">-150-</a></span>sons of rank and
fortune, and did not extend beyond that barrier where no general
injury could accrue to Society, there might be a shadow of excuse (and
it would be but a shadow) for not hazarding an attack upon the
amusements of the Great, where the energy of the Laws to controul
their &#339;conomy may be doubtful: but surely in the present case,
where the mischief spreads <i>broad</i> and <i>wide</i>, no good Magistrate can
or ought to be afraid to do his duty, because persons in high life may
dare to sanction and promote offences of a nature the most mischievous
to Society at large, as well as to the peace, comfort, and happiness
of families.</p>

<p>If the exertions of the Magistracy are to be suspended until the
Higher Ranks see the frivolity, the shameful profligacy and the horrid
waste of useful time, as well as the cruel destruction of decent and
respectable families in that point of view which will operate as an
antidote to the evil, it is much to be feared that it must, under such
circumstances, become incurable.</p>

<p>But there are other inducements, more nearly allied to the occurrences
in humble life, which render it in a particular degree incumbent on
Magistrates to make trial, at least, whether there is not sufficient
energy in the law to control the hurtful vices of the higher, as well
as the middling, and inferior ranks of the People: The examples of the
great and opulent, operate most powerfully among the tribe of <i>menial
servants</i> they employ; and these carry with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">-151-</a></span> into the lower ranks
that spirit of gambling and dissipation which they have practised in
the course of their servitude; thus producing consequences of a most
alarming nature to the general interests of the Community. To the
contagion of such examples, is owing in a great measure the number of
persons attached to pursuits of this kind, who become the Swindlers,
Sharpers, and Cheats, of an inferior class, described in the <a href="#CHAP_V">preceding
Chapter</a>: and from the same source spring up those Pests of Society,
<i>The Lottery Insurers</i>, whose iniquitous proceedings we shall in the
next place lay before the Reader.</p>

<p>These, with some exceptions, are composed of persons, in general very
depraved or distressed: the depredations committed on the Public by
their means are so ruinous and extensive as to require a consideration
peculiarly minute: in order to guard the ignorant and unwary, as much
as possible, against the fatal effects of that fraud and delusion,
which, if not soon checked, bid fair to destroy all remains of honesty
and discretion.&mdash;These Classes consist of</p>

<p><i>Sharpers, who take Lottery Insurances</i>, by which means gambling,
among the higher and middling ranks, is carried on, to an extent which
exceeds all credibility; producing consequences to many private
families, otherwise of great worth and respectability, of the most
distressing nature; and implicating in this misery, the innocent and
amiable branches of such families, whose sufferings, arising from this
source, while they claim the tear of pity, would re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">-152-</a></span>quire many volumes
to recount; but silence and shame throw a veil over the calamity: and,
cherished by the hopes of retrieving former losses, or acquiring
property, in an easy way, the evil goes on, and seems even yet to
increase, in spite of every guard which the Legislature has repeatedly
endeavoured to establish.</p>

<p>With a very few exceptions all who are or have been proprietors of the
Gambling Houses are also concerned in the fraudulent Insurance
Offices; and have a number of Clerks employed during the drawing of
the two Lotteries, who conduct the business without risk in
counting-houses, where no insurances are taken, but to which books are
carried, not only from all the different Offices in every part of the
town, but also from the Morocco-Men; so called, from their going from
door to door with a book covered with red leather for the purpose of
taking insurances, and enticing the poor and the middle ranks to
become adventurers.</p>

<p><i>Several of the Keepers of Insurance Offices, during the interval of
the drawing of the English and Irish Lotteries</i> have invented and set
up private Lotteries, or Wheels, called by the nick-name of <i>Little
Go's</i>, containing Blanks and Prizes, which are drawn for the purpose
of establishing <i>a ground for Insurance</i>; the fever in the minds of
the lower order of the people is thus kept up, in some measure, all
the year round, and produces incalculable mischiefs; and hence the
spirit of gambling becomes so rooted from habit, that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">-153-</a></span> domestic
distress, no consideration, arising either with the frauds that are
practised, or the number of chances that are against them, will
operate as a check upon their minds.</p>

<p>In spite of the high price of provisions, and of the care and
attention of the Legislature in establishing severe checks and
punishments for the purpose of preventing the evil of Lottery
Insurances, these criminal agents feel no want of customers; their
houses and offices are not only extremely numerous all over the
Metropolis; but in general <i>high-rented</i>; exhibiting the appearance of
considerable expence, and barricadoed in such a manner, with iron
doors and other contrivances, as in many instances to defy the arm of
the Law to reach them.</p>

<p>In tracing all the circumstances connected with this interesting
subject, with a view to the discovery of the cause of the great
encouragement which these Lottery Insurers receive, it appears that a
considerable proportion of their emolument is derived from <i>menial
servants</i> in general, all over the Metropolis; but particularly from
the pampered male and female domestics in the houses of men of fashion
and fortune; who are said, almost without a single exception, to be in
the constant habit of insuring in the English and Irish Lotteries.</p>

<p>This class of <i>menials</i>, being in many instances cloathed as well as
fed by their masters, have not the same calls upon them as labourers
and mechanics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">-154-</a></span> who must appropriate at least a part of their earnings
to the purpose of obtaining both food and raiment.</p>

<p>With a spirit of gambling, rendered more ardent than prevails in
vulgar life, from the example of their superiors, and from their idle
and dissipated habits, these servants enter keenly into the Lottery
business; and when ill luck attends them, it is but too well known
that many are led, step by step, to that point where they lose sight
of all moral principle; impelled by a desire to recover what they have
lost, they are induced to raise money for that purpose, by selling or
pawning the property of their masters, wherever it can be pilfered in
a little way, without detection; till at length this species of
peculation, by being rendered familiar to their minds, generally
terminates in more atrocious crimes.</p>

<p>Upon a supposition that one hundred thousand families in the
Metropolis keep two servants upon an average, and that one servant
with another insures only to the extent of twenty-five shillings each,
in the English, and the same in the Irish Lottery, the aggregate of
the whole will amount to <span class="smcap">Half a Million Sterling</span>.</p>

<p>Astonishing as this may appear at first view, it is believed that
those who will minutely examine into the Lottery transactions of their
servants, will find the calculation by no means exaggerated; and when
to this are added the sums drawn from persons in the middle ranks of
life, as well as from the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">-155-</a></span> classes of labourers and artisans
who have caught the mania; it ceases to be a matter of wonder, that so
many Sharpers, Swindlers, and Cheats, find encouragement in this
particular department.</p>

<p>If servants in general, who are under the control of masters, were
prevented from following this abominable species of gambling; and if
other expedients were adopted, which will be hereafter detailed, a
large proportion of the present race of rogues and vagabonds who
follow this infamous trade, would be compelled to become honest; and
the poor would be shielded from the delusion which impels them to
resort to this deceitful and fraudulent expedient; at the expence
sometimes of pledging every article of household goods, as well as the
last rag of their own, and their children's wearing apparel, not
leaving even a single change of raiment!</p>

<p>This view of a very prominent and alarming evil, known to exist from a
variety of facts well established and evinced, among others, by the
pawnbrokers' shops overflowing with the goods of the labouring poor,
during the drawing of the three Lotteries, ought to create a strong
desire on the part of all masters of families, to exert their utmost
endeavours to check this destructive propensity; and to prevent, as
far as possible, those distresses and mischiefs which every person of
humanity must deplore. The misery and loss of property which springs
from this delusive source of iniquity, is certainly very far beyond
any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">-156-</a></span> idea that can be formed of it by the common observer.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>A general Association, or perhaps an act of Parliament, establishing
proper regulations, applicable to this and other objects, with regard
to menial servants, would be of great utility.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">-157-</a></span></p>

<p>If a Legislative regulation could also be established, extending
certain restrictions to the members of the different <i>Friendly
Societies</i> situated within the Bills of Mortality, with regard to
Fraudulent Lottery Insurances, above <i>seventy thousand families</i> would
be relieved from the consequences of this insinuating evil; which has
been so fatal to the happiness and comfort of a vast number of
tradesmen and artisans, as well as inferior classes of labourers.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Such prohibitions and restraints would have a wonderful effect in
lessening the profits of the Lottery-Office Keepers; which, perhaps,
is the very best mode of suppressing the evil.&mdash;At present, the
temptation to follow these fraudulent practices is so great, from the
productive nature of the business, that unless some new expedient be
resorted to, no well-grounded hope can be entertained of lessening the
evil in any material degree.</p>

<p>In addition, therefore, to what has already been suggested on the
subject, other expedients have occurred to the Author; and some have
been suggested by persons well informed on this subject.</p>

<p>The Lottery in itself, if the poorer classes could be exempted from
its mischiefs, has been considered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">-158-</a></span> many good Writers and Reasoners
as a fair resource of Revenue; by taxing the vices or follies of the
People, in a country where such a considerable proportion of the
higher and middling ranks are possessed of large properties in money,
and may be induced, through this medium to contribute to the
assistance of the State, what would (probably to the same extent) be
otherwise squandered and dissipated, in idle amusements.</p>

<p>It is a means also of benefit to the Nation, by drawing considerable
sums of money annually from foreign Countries, which are laid out in
the purchase of tickets.</p>

<p>In many respects therefore, it might be desirable to preserve this
source of Revenue if it can be confined to the purchase of Tickets,
and to persons of such opulence, as upon the abolition of the Lottery
could not probably be restrained from squandering their money in
another way, from which the State would derive no benefit.</p>

<p>The Lottery, on the plan upon which it is at present conducted, has
not yet ceased to be an evil of the utmost magnitude, and perhaps one
of the greatest nurseries of crimes that ever existed in any
country.&mdash;At the close of the English Lottery drawn in 1796, the Civil
Power was trampled upon and put to defiance in a most alarming and
shameful manner, disgraceful to the Police of the Metropolis. The
means used for this purpose have been already fully detailed; <i>ante</i>
<a href="#Page_156"><i>p.</i> 156</a> <i>in the note</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">-159-</a></span></p>

<p>The profits of these Cheats and Swindlers were said to be immense
beyond all former example, during the Lottery drawn in the spring both
of 1796 and 1797; and of course, the Poor were never in a greater
degree plundered.</p>

<p>In calculating the chances upon the whole numbers in the wheels, and
the premiums which are paid, there is generally about 33 1-3d per
cent. in favour of the Lottery Insurers; but when it is considered
that the lower ranks, from not being able to recollect or comprehend
high numbers, always fix on low ones, the chance in favour of the
insurer is greatly increased, and the deluded Poor are plundered, to
an extent which really exceeds all calculation.</p>

<p>At no period is there ever so much occasion for the exertions of the
Magistracy, as during the drawing of the English and Irish Lotteries;
but it is to be feared, that even by this energy, opposed as it always
undoubtedly will be, by a System as well of corruption as of force
unexampled in former times, no proper check can be given, until by new
Legislative regulations, some more effectual remedy is applied.</p>

<p>The following expedients with the assistance of a superintending,
energetic, and well-regulated Police, it is to be hoped, might be the
means of greatly abridging this enormous evil, and of securing to
Government the same annual revenue, which is at present obtained, or
nearly so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">-160-</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"1. That the numbers of the Tickets to be placed in the
Lottery Wheels shall not be <i>running numbers</i>, as heretofore
used; but shall be <i>intermediate</i> and <i>broken</i>; thereby
preventing insurances from being made on specific numbers,
from the impossibility of its being known, to any but the
<i>holders of tickets, or the Commissioners</i>, what particular
ticket at anytime remains in the wheel.</p>

<p>"2. That all persons taking out licences to sell Lottery
Tickets, shall (instead of the bond with two sureties for
one thousand pounds, now entered into under the act of the
22d George 3. cap. 47,) enter into a bond, with two sureties
also, for £.50,000&mdash;which sum shall be forfeited, on due
proof that any person, so licensed, shall have been,
directly or indirectly, concerned in taking insurances
contrary to law; or in setting up, or being connected in the
profit or loss arising from any illegal insurance-office: or
in employing itinerant Clerks, to take insurances on account
of persons so licensed.</p>

<p>"3. That besides the above-mentioned bond, all licensed
Lottery Office Keepers shall, previous to the drawing of
each Lottery, make oath before a Magistrate, that they will
not, in the course of the ensuing Lottery, be concerned,
either directly or indirectly, in setting up any illegal
offices for the sale of tickets, or insurance of numbers,
contrary to law: Which affidavit shall be recorded, and a
certificate thereof shall be indorsed on the licence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">-161-</a></span>
without which it shall not be valid. And that the affidavit
may be produced in evidence, against persons convicted of
illegally insuring; who shall in that event be liable to the
punishment attached to perjury, and of course, to the
ignominy of the pillory and imprisonment.</p>

<p>"4. That all peace-officers, constables, headboroughs, or
others, lawfully authorised to execute the warrants of
Magistrates, who shall receive any gratuity, or sum of money
from illegal Lottery Insurers, or from any person or
persons, in consideration of any expected services in
screening such offenders from detection or punishment,
shall, on conviction, be rendered infamous, and incapable of
ever serving any public office; and be punished by fines,
imprisonment, or the pillory, as the Court, before whom the
offence is tried, shall see proper.</p>

<p>"5. That all persons who shall be convicted of <i>paying
money</i> on any contract for the benefit arising from the
drawing of any Lottery Ticket, insured upon any contingency
(not being in possession of the original ticket, or a legal
share thereof) shall forfeit £.20 for every offence, to be
levied by distress, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"6. That an abstract of the penalties inflicted by law on
persons insuring, or taking illegal insurances in the
Lottery, shall be read every Sunday, in all churches,
chapels, meeting-houses, and other places of public worship,
during the drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">-162-</a></span> of the Irish and English Lotteries
respectively; with a short exhortation, warning the people
of the consequences of offending against the law: And that a
copy of the same shall be pasted up in different parts of
Guildhall, and constantly replaced during the drawing of the
Lottery; and also at all the licensed Lottery Offices within
the Metropolis.</p>

<p>"7. That a reward, not exceeding £.50 be paid to any person
employed as a clerk or servant in any illegal Lottery
Office, who shall be the means of convicting the actual or
principal proprietor or proprietors of the said office, who
shall not appear themselves in the management; also a sum
not exceeding £.40 on conviction of a known and acting
proprietor; and a sum not exceeding £.10 on conviction of
any clerk or manager, not being partners.</p>

<p>"8. That the punishment to be inflicted on offenders shall
be fine, imprisonment, or the pillory; according to the
atrocity of the offence, in the discretion of the Court
before which such offenders shall be tried."</p></div>

<p>The following Plans have also been transmitted to the Author by
Correspondents who appear to be well-wishers to Society. They are here
made public, in hopes that from the whole of the suggestions thus
offered, some regulations may ultimately be adopted by the Legislature
towards effectually remedying this peculiarly dangerous and
still-increasing evil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">-163-</a></span></p>


<h3><a name="PLAN_I" id="PLAN_I"></a><span class="gesperrt">PLAN</span> I.</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">It</span> is proposed, that the <i>Prizes only</i> should be drawn, and that
Seven Hours and a Half per Day should be the time of drawing, instead
of Five Hours, by which means a lottery of the same number of tickets
now drawn in thirty-five days, would be drawn in seven days and a
half; and each adventurer would have exactly the same chance as he has
by the present mode of drawing; since it is evidently of no
consequence to him whether all the blanks remain in the Number Wheel
undrawn, or an equal number of Blanks are drawn from a blank and prize
wheel; the chance of blank or prize on <i>each ticket</i> being in either
case exactly the same.</p>

<p>"According to the usual mode of drawing, 50,000 tickets take about
thirty-five days in drawing, which is 1,420-6/7 per day.&mdash;By
increasing the time of each day's drawing, from five hours to seven
and a half, 2,131 tickets would be drawn each day; but as the reading
prizes above £.20 <i>thrice</i>, causes some little delay, I reckon only
2000 per day; at which rate 15,000 tickets, the usual proportion of
prizes in a Lottery of 50,000 tickets, would be drawn in seven days
and a half. Thus the <i>Period</i> of Insurance would be nearly reduced to
one-fifth part of its present duration, and the <i>daily</i> insurance on
<i>Blanks</i>, and <i>Blank and Prize</i>, which opens the most extensive field
for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">-164-</a></span> gambling, would be <i>entirely abolished</i>. Reducing, therefore, the
time of Insurance to one-fifth, and the numbers drawn to less than
one-third of what they have hitherto been, there could scarce remain
in Lotteries thus drawn, one-fifteenth part of the insurance as in
former Lotteries of an equal number of Tickets.&mdash;It is also worthy of
remark, that as all the late Lotteries have been thirty-five days at
least in drawing, the Insurance Offices had thirty-four to one in
their favour the first day, by which circumstance they were enabled to
tempt chiefly that class of people who can only gamble on the lowest
terms, and to whom gambling is most extensively pernicious, with a
very moderate premium, (<i>e.g.</i> about twelve shillings to return twenty
pounds) which increases daily by almost imperceptible degrees, and
thus insensibly leads them on to misery, desperation, and guilt.</p>

<p>"But in the proposed Plan, the Insurance Offices would have only six
days and a half to one in their favour the first day; so that they
must begin with a much higher premium than the generality of the
common people can advance, which premium must each day be very
considerably increased.&mdash;These considerations would undoubtedly
operate as an absolute prohibition, on far the greatest part of
Lottery Insurers; beside which, the great probability of numbers
insured being drawn each day, would deter even the Office Keepers from
venturing to insure so deeply, or extensively, as they have been
accustomed to do.</p>

<p>"Should it be objected, that if Insurance is thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">-165-</a></span> abridged, or
prohibited, tickets will not sell, and the Lottery, as a source of
Revenue, must be abandoned: the following expedient may, it is
apprehended, effectually obviate such an objection.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let Tickets, which cannot now be legally divided below a sixteenth,
be divisible down to a <i>Sixty-fourth</i> share, properly stamped; which
regulation, while it would greatly benefit and encourage Licensed
Offices, would equally discountenance illegal Gamblers; and whilst it
permitted to the lower orders of the Community a fair chance of an
adventure in the Lottery on moderate terms, would co-operate with the
restrictions on Insurance to advance the intrinsic value, as well as
the price of tickets, which every illegal <i>Scheme</i> evidently tends to
depreciate."</p>

<p>The preceding Plan appeared in the Appendix to the fifth edition of
this Treatise; in consequence of which the Author received the
following observations and which therefore he presents as&mdash;</p>


<h3><span class="gesperrt">PLAN</span> II.</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> Suggestions as far as they extend and relate to the shortening
the duration of the drawing are highly useful, but they fall short of
the object, and the Plan, if executed, would nearly prevent the sale
of tickets, and totally so that of shares, and consequently abolish
Lotteries altogether;&mdash;a consummation devoutly to be wished by every
friend to the public, but under the pecuniary influences, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">-166-</a></span>

<p>"Hence it is evident, that on supposition the value of the Prizes
diminish by an equal ratio, every day of drawing, still the actual
value of the Prizes in proportion to the permanent number of the
Blanks will be diminished by the relative proportion increasing at the
rate of about 4666 Blanks every day after the first. Consequently it
must follow, that the premiums of insurance, as well as the price of
Shares and Tickets, instead of acquiring in their value <i>a very
considerable increase</i>, must be subject to a very considerable
diminution.</p>

<p>"To maintain the foregoing <a href="#PLAN_I">Plan, No. I.</a> which is a good ground-work
for lessening the evil, I take the liberty (says my Correspondent) of
suggesting the following improvement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">-167-</a></span></p>

<p>"After the Prizes are drawn each day, let the proportion of the
Blanks, namely, 4666 be drawn also. Let there be a suspension likewise
of five or seven days between each drawing for the sale of Tickets and
Shares, and to give time for insurance. It may be objected, that the
time being thus prolonged the inconvenience will remain the same; to
avoid which, the blank numbers so drawn, must be done secretly and
sealed up by the Commissioners, or, they may be drawn openly but not
unfolded or declared, and if necessary, made public after the drawing;
by which means the insurance against Blanks or Blank and Prize will be
equally abolished."</p>

<h3><span class="gesperrt">PLAN</span> III.</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> Evils of a Lottery are many.&mdash;The Advantages might, if well
regulated, be as numerous. According to the Schemes that have hitherto
prevailed the <i>principle</i> has been wrong. Since the bait held out has
been the obtaining of an immense fortune, and the risk has been
proportionably great&mdash;Insurance has reigned unchecked by all penalties
and punishments that could be devised to the ruin and misery of
thousands. The price of tickets has been fluctuating, and fortunes
have been won and lost on the chance of the great Prizes keeping in
the Wheel: the £.20 prizes have always proved dissatisfactory, as
though there are only 2&frac12; prizes <i>on an average</i> to a blank, yet
such is the uncertainty, that many have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">-168-</a></span> scores of tickets without
obtaining the proportionate advantage even from these low prizes. It
is thought, therefore, that a scheme which should offer considerably
more chances for prizes of and above £.50, and which should ensure a
return on all blanks, would be acceptable. If also it could be made to
prevent insuring of tickets and capitals, it seems to be the grand
desideratum in this branch of financeering.</p>

<p>"The principle on which these benefits may be obtained is this. There
should be a considerable number of moderate prizes, such as might be
fortunes, if obtained by the inferior ranks, and of consequence
sufficient to answer the risk of the rich. The tickets to be drawn
each day should be previously specified which may be done by
appropriating a certain share of the prizes to a certain number of
tickets. All the tickets not drawn prizes of £.50 or upwards shall be
entitled to a certain return, which would be superior to a chance for
a £.20 prize.</p>

<p>"In Lotteries where the lowest prizes have been of £.20 the blanks
have been the proportion of 2&frac12; to a prize. If therefore a person
had seven tickets they were entitled to expect only two £.20 prizes or
£.40. In this, however, they were frequently disappointed, and their
chance for a prize of £.50 or upwards has been as about 200 to 50,000.
By the above Scheme, if a person has seven tickets they are sure of a
return of £.35, and have the chance of 40 to 2000, or 1000 to 50,000
for a superior prize. The certainty of the numbers and the prizes to
be drawn each day would prevent insurance on those events, and every
ticket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">-170-</a></span> being a prize there could be no insurance against blanks.</p>

<p>"In fact, the Lottery might be drawn in one day,&mdash;thus: Let there be
twenty-five bags containing each 2000 numbers, either promiscuously
chosen or of stated thousands. Let there be also 25 bags each
containing the 40 prizes above appropriated to each day's drawing. Let
the Commissioners empty one bag of numbers and one of prizes into two
wheels. Let them draw 40 numbers out of the Number Wheel, and the 40
prizes out of the other. The remaining 1960 numbers to be entitled to
£.5 each.&mdash;Then let them proceed with other 2000 numbers in the same

<p>At all events, whether these Plans for reforming this enormous evil,
are or are not superior to others which have been devised, it is clear
to demonstration, that the present System is founded on a principle
not less erroneous than mischievous; and, therefore, it cannot too
soon be abandoned; especially since it would appear that the Revenue
it produces might be preserved, with the incalculable advantage to the
nation of preserving, at the same time, the morals of the people, and
turning into a course of industry and usefulness the labour of many
thousand individuals, who, instead of being, as at present, pests in
Society, might be rendered useful members of the State.</p>

<hr class="dbl1" />
<hr class="dbl2" />

<p><span class="cap">T</span>HE frauds committed by the fabrication of base Money, and by the
nefarious practices, in the introduction of almost every species of
Counterfeit Coin into the circulation of the Country, are next to be
discussed.</p>

<p>The great outlines of this enormous evil having been stated in the
<a href="#CHAPTER_I">first Chapter</a>, it now remains to elu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">-172-</a></span>cidate that part of the subject
which is connected with <i>specific detail</i>.</p>

<p>One of the greatest sources of these multiplied and increasing frauds
is to be traced to the various ingenious improvements which have taken
place of late years, at Birmingham, and other manufacturing towns, in
mixing metals, and in stamping and <i>colouring</i> ornamental buttons.</p>

<p>The same ingenious process is so easily applied to the coinage and
colouring of false money, and also to the mixing of the metals of
which it is composed, that it is not to be wondered at, that the
avarice of man, urged by the prospect of immense profit, has
occasioned that vast increase of counterfeit money of every
description, with which the Country is at present deluged.</p>

<p>The false coinages which have been introduced into circulation, of
late years, are <i>Guineas, Half-Guineas and Seven Shilling Pieces,
Crowns and Half-Crowns, Shillings, Sixpences, Pence, Halfpence, and
Farthings</i>, of the similitude of the coin of the realm: of foreign
coin, <i>Half Johannas, Louis d'ors, Spanish Dollars, French
Half-Crowns, Shillings and Sixpences, 30 Sol pieces, Prussian and
Danish Silver money, and other continental coins</i>; to which may be
added, <i>Sequins of Turkey, and Pagodas of India</i>. These foreign coins
except in the instance of the <i>Spanish Dollars</i><a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> issued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">-173-</a></span> by the
Bank of England in 1797, have generally been sold as articles of
commerce for the purpose of being fraudulently circulated in the
British Colonies or in Foreign Countries.</p>

<p>So dexterous and skilful have Coiners now become, that by mixing a
certain proportion of pure gold with a compound of base metal, they
can fabricate guineas that shall be full weight, and of such perfect
workmanship as to elude a discovery, except by persons of skill; while
the intrinsic value does not exceed thirteen or fourteen shillings,
and in some in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">-174-</a></span>stances is not more than eight or nine. Of this coinage
considerable quantities were circulated some years since, bearing the
impression of George the Second: and another coinage of counterfeit
guineas of the year 1793, bearing the impression of his present
Majesty, has been for some years in circulation, finished in a
masterly manner, and nearly full weight, although the intrinsic value
is not above eight shillings: half guineas are also in circulation of
the same coinage: and lately a good imitation of the seven-shilling
pieces. But as the fabrication of such coin requires a greater degree
of skill and ingenuity than generally prevails, and also a greater
capital than most coiners are able to command, it is to be hoped it
has gone to no great extent; for amidst all the abuses which have
prevailed of late years, it is unquestionably true, that the guineas
and half-guineas which have been counterfeited in a style to elude
detection, have borne no proportion in point of extent to the coinage
of base <i>Silver</i>. Of this latter there are <i>five</i> different kinds at
present counterfeited; and which we shall proceed to enumerate.</p>

<p><i>The first of these are denominated</i> Flats, from the circumstance of
this species of money being cut out of flatted plates, composed of a
mixture of silver and blanched copper. The proportion of silver runs
from one-fourth to one-third, and in some instances to even one-half:
the metals are mixed by a chemical preparation, and afterwards rolled
by flatting mills, into the thickness of <i>shillings</i>, <i>half-crowns</i>,
or <i>crowns</i>, ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">-175-</a></span>cording to the desire of the parties who bring the
copper and silver, which last is generally stolen plate. It is not
known that there are at present above one or two rolling mills in
London, although there are several in the Country, where all the
dealers and coiners of this species of base money resort, for the
purpose of having these plates prepared; from which, when finished,
<i>blanks</i> or round pieces are cut out, of the sizes of the money meant
to be counterfeited.</p>

<p>The artisans who stamp or coin these blanks into base money are seldom
interested themselves. They generally work as mechanics for the large
dealers who employ a capital in the trade;&mdash;and who furnish the
plates, and pay about eight per cent. for the coinage, being at the
rate of one penny for each shilling, and twopence-halfpenny for each
half-crown.</p>

<p>This operation consists first in turning the blanks in a lathe;&mdash;then
stamping them, by means of a press, with dies of the exact impression
of the coin intended to be imitated:&mdash;they are afterwards rubbed with
sandpaper and cork; then put into aquafortis to bring the silver to
the surface; then rubbed with common salt; then with cream of tartar;
then warmed in a shovel or similar machine before the fire; and last
of all rubbed with <i>blacking</i>, to give the money the appearance of
having been in circulation.</p>

<p>All these operations are so quickly performed, that two persons (a man
and his wife for instance,) can completely finish to the nominal
amount of fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">-176-</a></span> pounds in shillings and half-crowns in two days, by
which they will earn each two guineas a day.</p>

<p>A shilling of this species, which exhibits nearly the appearance of
what has been usually called a Birmingham shilling, is intrinsically
worth from <i>twopence to fourpence</i>; and crowns and half-crowns are in
the same proportion. The quantity made of this sort of counterfeit
coinage is very considerable: it requires less ingenuity than any of
the other methods of coining, though at the same time it is the most
expensive, and of course the least profitable to the Dealer; who for
the most part disposes of it to the utterers, vulgarly called
<i>Smashers</i>, at from 28<i>s.</i> to 40<i>s.</i> for a guinea, according to the
quality; while these <i>Smashers</i> generally manage to utter it again to
the full import value.</p>

<p><i>The Second Species of counterfeit Silver money</i> passes among the
dealers by the denomination of Plated Goods; from the circumstance of
the shillings and half-crowns being made of copper of a reduced size,
and afterwards plated with silver, so extended as to form a rim round
the edge. This coin is afterwards stamped with dies so as to resemble
the real coin; and, from the circumstance of the surface being pure
silver, is not easily discovered except by ringing the money on a
table: but as this species of base money requires a knowledge of
<i>plating</i> as well as a great deal of ingenuity, it is of course
confined to few hands. It is however extremely profitable to those who
carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">-177-</a></span> it on, as it can generally be uttered, without detection, at
its full import value.</p>

<p><i>The Third Species of base Silver-money is called</i> Plain Goods, and is
totally confined to shillings. These are made of copper blanks turned
in a lathe, of the exact size of a Birmingham shilling, afterwards
silvered over by a particular operation used in colouring metal
buttons; they are then rubbed over with cream of tartar and blacking,
after which they are fit for circulation.</p>

<p>These shillings do not cost the makers above one halfpenny each: they
are sold very low to the <i>Smashers</i> or <i>Utterers</i>, who pass them where
they can, at the full nominal value; and when the silver wears off,
which is very soon the case, they are sold to the Jews as bad
shillings, who generally resell them at a small profit to customers,
by whom they are recoloured, and thus soon brought again into
circulation. The profit is immense, owing to the trifling value of the
materials; but the circulation, on account of the danger of discovery,
it is to be hoped is not yet very extensive. It is, however, to be
remarked, that it is a species of coinage not of a long standing.</p>

<p><i>The Fourth Class</i> of counterfeit silver-money is known by the name of
<span class="smcap">Castings</span> or <span class="smcap">Cast Goods</span>. This species of work requires great skill and
ingenuity, and is therefore confined to few hands; for none but
excellent artists can attempt it, with any prospect of great success.</p>

<p>The process is to melt blanched copper, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">-178-</a></span> cast it in moulds,
having the impression, and being of the size of a <i>crown</i>, a
<i>half-crown</i>, a <i>shilling</i>, or a <i>sixpence</i>, as the case may be; after
being removed from the moulds, the money thus formed is cleaned off,
and afterwards neatly silvered over by an operation similar to that
which takes place in the manufacture of buttons.</p>

<p>The counterfeit money made in imitation of shillings by this process,
is generally cast so as to have a <i>crooked appearance</i>; and the
deception is so admirable, that although intrinsically not worth <i>one
halfpenny</i>, by exhibiting the appearance of a <i>thick crooked
shilling</i>, they enter into circulation without suspicion, and are
seldom refused while the surface exhibits no part of the copper; and
even after this the itinerant Jews will purchase them at threepence
each though six times their intrinsic value, well knowing that they
can again be recoloured at the expence of half a farthing, so as to
pass without difficulty for their nominal value of twelve pence.&mdash;A
vast number of the sixpences now in circulation is of this species of
coinage.</p>

<p>The profit in every view, whether to the original maker, or to the
subsequent purchasers (after having lost their colour,) is <i>immense</i>.</p>

<p>In fabricating Cast Money, the workmen are always more secure than
where presses and dies are used; because upon the least alarm, and
before any officer of justice can have admission, the counterfeits are
thrown into the crucible; the moulds are destroyed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">-179-</a></span> and nothing is to
be found that can convict, or even criminate the offender: on this
account the present makers of cast money have reigned long, and were
they careful and frugal, they might have become extremely rich; but
prudence rarely falls to the lot of men who live by acts of
criminality.</p>

<p>The <i>Fifth and last Species</i> of base coin made in imitation of
silver-money of the realm is called Figs or Fig Things. It is a very
inferior sort of counterfeit money, of which composition, however, a
great part of the sixpences now in circulation are made. The
proportion of silver is not, generally speaking, of the value of one
farthing in half a crown; although there are certainly some
exceptions, as counterfeit sixpences have been lately discovered, some
with a mixture, and some wholly silver; but even these did not yield
the makers less than from 50 to 80 per cent. while the profit on the
former is not less than from five hundred to one thousand per cent.
and sometimes more.</p>

<p>It is impossible to estimate the amount of this base money which has
entered into the circulation of the Country during the last twenty
years; but it must be very great, since one of the principal Coiners
of stamped money, who some time since left off business, and made some
important discoveries, acknowledged to the Author, that he had coined
to the extent of <i>two hundred thousand pounds</i> sterling in counterfeit
<i>half-crowns</i>, and other base silver money, in a period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">-180-</a></span> of seven
years. This is the less surprising, as two persons can stamp and
finish to the amount of from 200<i>l.</i> to 300<i>l.</i> a week.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Of the Copper Money made in imitation of the current coin of the
realm, there are many different sorts sold at various prices,
according to the size and weight; but in general they may be divided
into two kinds, namely, the stamped and the plain halfpence, of both
which kind immense quantities have been made in London; and also in
Birmingham, Wedgbury, Bilston, and Wolverhampton, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The plain halfpence are generally made at Birmingham; and from their
thickness, afford a wonderful deception. They are sold, however, by
the coiners to the large dealers at about a farthing each, or 100 per
cent. profit in the tale or aggregate number. These dealers are not
the <i>utterers</i>; but sell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">-181-</a></span> them again by retail in <i>pieces</i>, or
<i>five-shilling papers</i>, at the rate of from 28<i>s.</i> to 31<i>s.</i> for a
guinea; not only to the Smashers, but also to persons in different
trades, as well in the Metropolis as in the Country Towns, who pass
them in the course of their business at the full import value.</p>

<p>Farthings are also made in considerable quantities, chiefly in London,
but so very thin that the profit upon this species of coinage is much
greater than on the halfpence, though these counterfeits are not now,
as formerly, made of base metal. The copper of which they are made is
generally pure. The advantage lies in the weight alone, where the
<i>coiners</i>, <i>sellers</i>, and <i>utterers</i>, do not obtain less than 200 per
cent. A well known coiner has been said to finish from sixty to eighty
pounds sterling a week. Of halfpence, two or three persons can stamp
and finish to the nominal amount of at least two hundred pounds in six
days.</p>

<p>When it is considered that there are seldom less than between forty
and fifty coinages or private mints, almost constantly employed in
London and in different country towns; in stamping and fabricating
base silver and copper money, the evil may justly be said to have
arrived at an enormous height. It is indeed true that these people
have been a good deal interrupted and embarrassed from time to time,
by detections and convictions; but while the laws are so inapplicable
to the new tricks and devices they have resorted to, these convictions
are only <i>a drop in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">-182-</a></span> bucket</i>: while such encouragements are held
out the execution of one rogue only makes room for another to take up
his customers; and indeed as the offence of selling is only a
misdemeanor it is no unusual thing for the wife and family of a
culprit, or convicted <i>seller</i> of <i>base money</i> to carry on the
business, and to support him luxuriously in Newgate, until the
expiration of the <i>year</i> and <i>day's</i> imprisonment, which is generally
the punishment inflicted for this species of offence.</p>

<p>It has been already stated [<a href="#Page_16"><i>page</i> 16</a>, &amp;c.] that trading in base money
has now become as regular and systematic as any fair branch of
trade.&mdash;</p>

<p>Certain it is, that immense quantities have been regularly sent from
London to the Camps during the summer season; and to persons at the
sea-ports and manufacturing towns, who again sell in retail to the
different tradesmen and others who pass them at the full <i>import</i>
value.</p>

<p>In this nefarious traffic a number of the lower order of the German
Jews in London assist the dealers in an eminent degree, particularly
in the circulation of bad halfpence.</p>

<p>It has not been an unusual thing for several of these dealers to hold
a kind of market every morning, where from forty to fifty of these
German Jew boys are regularly supplied with counterfeit halfpence;
which they dispose of in the course of the day in different streets
and lanes of the Metropolis, for <i>bad shillings</i>, at about 3<i>d.</i> each.
Care is always taken that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">-183-</a></span> the person who cries bad shillings shall
have a companion near him who carries the halfpence, and takes charge
of the purchased shillings (which are not cut:) so as to elude the
detection of the Officers of the Police, in the event of being
searched.</p>

<p>The bad shillings thus purchased, are received in payment by the
employers of the boys, for the bad halfpence supplied them, at the
rate of four shillings a dozen; and are generally resold to
<i>Smashers</i>, at a profit of two shillings a dozen; who speedily
re-colour them, and introduce them again into circulation, at their
full nominal value.</p>

<p>The boys will generally clear from five to seven shillings a day, by
this fraudulent business; which they almost uniformly spend, during
the evening, in riot and debauchery; returning pennyless in the
morning to their old trade.</p>

<p>Thus it is that the frauds upon the Public multiply beyond all
possible conception, while the tradesman, who, unwarily at least if
not improperly, sells his counterfeit shillings to Jew boys at
threepence each, little suspects that it is for the purpose of being
returned upon him again at the rate of twelve-pence; or 300 per cent.
profit to the purchasers and utterers.</p>

<p>But these are not the only criminal devices to which the coiners and
dealers, as well as the utterers of base money, have had recourse, for
answering their iniquitous purposes.</p>

<p>Previous to the Act of the 37 Geo. 3. cap. 126,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">-184-</a></span> counterfeit French
crowns, half-crowns, and shillings, of excellent workmanship, were
introduced with a view to elude the punishment of the then deficient
Laws relative to Foreign Coin.</p>

<p>Fraudulent die-sinkers are to be found both in the Metropolis and in
Birmingham, who are excellent artists; able and willing to copy the
exact similitude of any coin, from the British guinea to the sequin of
Turkey, or to the Star Pagoda of Arcot. The delinquents have therefore
every opportunity and assistance they can wish for; while their
accurate knowledge of the deficiency of the laws, (particularly
relative to British Coin) and where the point of danger lies, joined
to the extreme difficulty of detection, operates as a great
encouragement to this species of treason, felony, and fraud; and
affords the most forcible reason why these pests of society still
continue to afflict the honest part of the community.</p>

<p>An opinion prevails, founded on information obtained through the
medium of the most intelligent of these coiners and dealers, that of
the counterfeit money now in circulation, not above one third part is
of the species of <i>Flats</i> or <i>composition money</i>; which has been
mentioned as the most intrinsically valuable of counterfeit silver,
and contains from one fourth to one third silver; the remainder being
blanched copper.&mdash;The other two thirds of the counterfeit money being
<i>cast</i> or <i>washed</i>, and intrinsically worth little or nothing, the
imposition upon the public is obvious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">-185-</a></span> Taking the whole upon an
average, the amount of the injury may be fairly calculated at within
ten per cent. of a total loss upon the mass of the base silver money
now in circulation; which, if a conclusion may be drawn from what
passes under the review of any person who has occasion to receive
silver in exchange, must considerably exceed <i>one million sterling</i>!
To this we have the miserable prospect of an accession every year,
until some effectual steps shall be taken to remedy the evil.</p>

<p>Of the Copper Coinage, the quantity of counterfeits at one time in
circulation might be truly said to equal three fourth parts of the
whole, and nothing is more certain than that a very great proportion
of the actual counterfeits passed as Mint halfpence, from their size
and appearance, although they yielded the coiners a large profit.</p>

<p>Even at present the state both of the silver and copper coinage of
this kingdom (the copper pence only excepted) deserves very particular
attention, for at no time can any person minutely examine either the
one coin or the other, which may come into his possession, without
finding a considerable proportion counterfeit.</p>

<p>Until, therefore, a new coinage of halfpence and farthings takes place
upon the excellent plan adopted by Government, with respect to the
pence now partially in circulation, what must be the situation of the
retail dealers, the brewers, distillers, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">-186-</a></span> other classes of
industrious traders, who in the course of their business, are
compelled to receive depreciated counterfeit money?<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The burden is not only grievous beyond expression, to those who have
no alternative but to take such base money in payment; but extends
indirectly to <i>the Poor</i>: in as much as the diminished value of such
coin, arising from its reduced or base quality taken in connection
with the quantities thrown into circulation, tends to enhance the
price of the first articles of necessity.</p>

<p>The labourer, the handicraftsman, and the working manufacturer, being
generally paid their weekly wages, partly in copper money of
depreciated value;&mdash;it is obvious that they must obtain less than they
would otherwise receive, were the coin of a higher standard; for the
retail dealers who furnish the poor with food, must shield themselves,
at least in part,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">-187-</a></span> against the unavoidable losses arising from base
money; by advancing the prices of their various commodities.</p>

<p>Nor are such advances made upon a principle which cannot be defended;
since it is evident that the relative value <i>even of the old copper
coin of the Mint</i> to gold or silver, is nearly <i>twice its intrinsic
value</i>; and while such copper money cannot be paid into the receipt of
his Majesty's Exchequer, or received in payment by the officers of the
revenue, the burden and loss of a diminished coin fall entirely upon
the traders, (who are compelled to receive such money,) and upon the
labourers and mechanics through whose medium it is chiefly circulated.</p>

<p>While the disproportion thus stated between the denominative value of
copper and silver money is so very great, it is evident that the legal
coinage of copper must produce an immense profit; as <i>one pound</i> of
copper estimated at 15 <i>pence</i><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> will make as many halfpence, of the
legal coinage, as pass for <i>two shillings</i>.</p>

<p>This fact plainly shews the vast temptation which is held out to those
who carry on the counterfeit coinage, where the profit from the coiner
to the dealers, and from these dealers to the utterers, at the full
de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">-188-</a></span>nominative value, must be in many instances from two to three
hundred per cent. When to this circumstance is added the security
which the deficiencies in the present laws hold out, the whole
operates as a kind of bounty to these fraudulent people, who cannot
resist the prosecution of a trade where the profit is so immense, and
where a coinage equally <i>pure and heavy</i> as the old mint standard
would even be extremely productive.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>In every view the evil at present arising from base money of every
denomination appears to be of the greatest magnitude&mdash;while its extent
will scarce be credited by any but those who have turned their
attention very minutely to the subject.</p>

<p>The trade of dealing in counterfeit coin acquires its greatest vigour
towards the end of March; for then the Lotteries are over, when
<i>Swindlers</i>, <i>Gamblers</i>, <i>Pretended Dealers in Horses</i>, <i>Travellers
with EO Tables</i>, and <i>Hawkers</i> and <i>Pedlars</i> go into the country,
carrying with them considerable quantities of base silver and copper
money; by which they are enabled, in a great degree, to extend the
circulation, by cheating and defrauding ignorant country people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">-189-</a></span></p>

<p>In the spring season too, the dealers in counterfeit coin begin to
make up their orders for the different country towns; and it is
supposed, upon good grounds, that there is now scarcely a place of any
consequence all over the kingdom where they have not their
correspondents; it is also a fact well established, that many of these
correspondents come regularly to the <i>Metropolis</i>, and also go to
Birmingham and the neighbouring towns once or twice a year for the
purpose of purchasing base money, where the evil is said to be
increasing even more than in London.</p>

<p>It very seldom happens, on account of the great demand, (especially of
late years) that the dealers have ever any considerable stock on hand.
The base money is no sooner finished, than it is packed up and sent to
customers in town and country; and with such rapidity has it been
fabricated, on occasions of pressing emergency, that a single dealer
has been known to procure from the coiners who worked for him, from
£.300 to £.500 for country orders, in the course of the week!</p>

<p>The lower ranks among the Irish, and the German Jews, are the chief
supporters of the trade of circulating base money in London;&mdash;there is
said to be scarce an Irish labourer who does not exchange his week's
wages for base money; taking a mixture of shillings, sixpences, and
copper.</p>

<p>The Jews principally confine themselves to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">-190-</a></span> coinage and
circulation of copper; while the Irish women are the chief utterers
and colourers of base silver. A vast number of these low females have
acquired the mischievous art of colouring the bad shillings and
sixpences, which they purchase from the employers of Jew-boys, who cry
<i>bad shillings</i>.</p>

<p>It is somewhat singular that among the Jews, although many cases occur
where they appear to be coiners of copper money and dealers to a great
extent, yet scarce an instance can be adduced of their having any
concern in the coinage of base silver: neither are they extensive
dealers in any other base money than copper.</p>

<p>The Jews, however, deal largely in foreign coin, counterfeited in this
country; having been the chief means by which <i>Louis d'Ors</i>, <i>Half
Johannas</i>, as well as various silver coins, (particularly <i>Dollars</i>)
made of base metal, have been sent out of this country. It is through
the same channel that the Sequins of Turkey have been exported; and
also the Pagodas of India.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>In contemplating and in developing the causes of the vast accumulation
and increase of base money, which has thus deluged the country of late
years, the evil will be found to have proceeded chiefly from the want
of <i>a new coinage:&mdash;of laws, applicable to the new tricks and devices
practised by the coiners:&mdash;of proper checks upon fraudulent
Circulation:&mdash;of rewards for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">-191-</a></span> the detection and apprehension of
Offenders;&mdash;and of a sufficient fund to ensure the prompt execution of
the law; by a vigorous and energetic Police</i>, directed not only to the
execution of apposite laws in the detection and punishment of
offenders, but also to the means of prevention.</p>

<p>The vigour and energy requisite to put good and apposite laws in
execution for the suppression of crimes of every kind, but
particularly that of the coinage and circulation of base money, depend
much on the zeal and activity of the Magistrate: and on the affording
an adequate pecuniary resource, to enable him to reward men who may
undertake to risk their persons in the company of desperate and daring
offenders, in order to obtain that species of evidence which will
produce a conviction. Without such pecuniary resource, the law, as
well as the exertions of the Magistrate, becomes a dead letter: and
his efforts for the purpose of promoting the ends of public justice,
are crippled and lost to the Community.</p>

<p>In suppressing great evils, strong and adequate powers must be
applied, and nothing can give force and activity to these powers, but
the ability to reward liberally all persons engaged in the public
service, either as police officers, or as temporary agents for the
purpose of detecting atrocious offenders. The following ideas are
therefore suggested with a view to the important subject at present
under discussion.</p>

<p>The Coinage Laws (except those relating to cop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">-192-</a></span>per money) which
contain the most important regulations in the way of prevention,
having been made a century ago, it is not to be wondered at, in
consequence of the regular progress of the evil, and the new
contrivances and artifices resorted to, in that period, that many
obvious amendments have become necessary. A consolidation of the whole
laws from the 25th of Edward the Third, to the 14th of his present
Majesty, would, perhaps, be the most desirable object; as it would
afford a better opportunity of correcting every deficiency, and of
rendering this branch of the criminal code, <i>concise</i>, <i>clear</i>,
<i>explicit</i>,&mdash;applicable to the existing evils, and to the means of
prevention.</p>

<p>For the purpose, however, of more fully elucidating this proposition,
it will be necessary to state the existing laws, and what are
considered as the most apparent deficiencies therein.</p>

<p>We will begin by giving a short <i>Summary</i> of the existing Laws.</p>

<p>Since the last edition of this work the following additions have been
made to the Statute Law on this subject.</p>

<p>By 37 Geo. III. <i>c.</i> 126, so much of 15 Geo. II. <i>c.</i> 28, as relates
to <i>halfpence and farthings</i>, and the statute 11 Geo. III. <i>c.</i> 40,
and all other acts relating to the copper money of this realm, are
extended to all such copper money as shall be coined and issued, by
the King's Proclamation.&mdash;This was for the pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">-194-</a></span>pose of protecting the
Coinage of <i>penny</i> and <i>twopenny</i> pieces made for Government by Mr.
Boulton, of Birmingham; and which it is believed have not yet been
counterfeited, at least to any great extent.</p>

<p>By the same statute, 37 Geo. III. <i>c.</i> 126, persons counterfeiting any
<i>foreign gold or silver coin</i>, tho' not current in this realm, are
made guilty of felony, punishable by seven years' transportation; as
are also persons bringing the same into the realm, with intent to
utter it.&mdash;A penalty is imposed on persons tendering <i>such</i>
counterfeit coin in payment, <i>or exchange</i>; for the first offence, six
months' imprisonment: for the second, two years; and on the third,
they are declared guilty of felony without Clergy.&mdash;Persons having
more than <i>five</i> pieces of such counterfeit coin in their possession,
shall forfeit the same, and also a penalty of not more than £.5, nor
less than 40<i>s.</i> for each piece; or suffer three months'
imprisonment.&mdash;Justices are impowered to grant warrants for searching
suspected places, <i>for such counterfeit foreign coin</i>; which with the
tools and materials may be seized and carried before a Justice, who
shall secure the same as evidence: to be afterwards destroyed.</p>

<p>By statute 38 Geo. III. <i>c.</i> 59, the act 14 Geo. III. <i>c.</i> 42,
prohibiting the importation of light silver coin of this realm, was
revived and continued till June 1, 1799.&mdash;And by statute 39 Geo. III.
<i>c.</i> 75, it was made perpetual.</p>

<p>By statute 38 Geo. III. <i>c.</i> 67, <i>Copper Coin</i> not being the legal
Copper Coin of this realm, and <i>all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">-195-</a></span> counterfeit gold or silver coin
whatever</i>, exported, or shipped for exportation, to Martinique or any
of the British Colonies in the West Indies or America, is declared to
be forfeited, and may be seized as under the laws respecting the
Customs.&mdash;And a penalty is imposed on persons exporting it, of £.200
and double the value of the coin.</p>

<p>We next proceed to state the deficiencies which still remain
unremedied.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. The punishment inflicted on the different offences
specified in the Coinage Laws, do not seem to be adequate to
the degree of enormity, in some instances; while in others,
from being too severe, the law is not always put in
execution. The sale of base Money (for instance) under the
value it imports, is only punishable by a year's
imprisonment; although in point of fact, it is well known,
that the Sellers are the <i>Employers of the Coiners</i>; that
with them this high offence originates, and but for them it
would not have been committed: while the actual Coiners, who
work for these Dealers merely as Journeymen, subject
themselves to the punishment of Death.</p>

<p>2. Prosecutions under the stat. 8 &amp; 9 W. III. <i>c.</i> 26, are
at present limited to commence within three months. This may
often defeat justice, as offences committed in the country
frequently cannot be tried in less than four, five, and in
some cases nearly six months. <span class="hand" title="pointing hand">&#9758;</span> <i>The limitation to
twelve months would remove the difficulty.</i> [There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">-196-</a></span> is no
such limitation in the statutes of 37 &amp; 38 of Geo. III. just
alluded to.]</p>

<p>3. The words <i>Milled Money</i> seemed necessary, in the minds
of the makers of the act of 8 &amp; 9 William III. <i>cap.</i> 26, to
form the description of coin similar to the current Coin of
the Realm; and that Act declares it to be felony to take,
receive, pay, or put off <i>counterfeit milled Money</i>.&mdash;A
considerable portion of counterfeit Coin is <i>cast</i>, and <i>not
milled</i>. <span class="hand" title="pointing hand">&#9758;</span> <i>The words</i> counterfeit Money, Milled <i>or</i>
not Milled, <i>would remove the ambiguity.</i></p>

<p>4. It does not appear that any provision is clearly made, or
punishment inflicted, for the offence of <i>uttering base
silver Money in exchange</i>, as well as in payment: except
under <i>stat.</i> 8 and 9 Will. III. <i>cap.</i> 26, where the
expression of <i>counterfeited milled money</i> is used, the
ambiguity of which has already been noticed. The words in
the <i>stat.</i> 15 Geo. II. <i>c.</i> 28. are, "any person who shall
utter or tender in payment," and it seems that the word
<i>utter</i> cannot be detached from the subsequent words, "in
payment." [The partial remedy applied in this particular in
the instance of counterfeit <i>foreign gold and silver coin</i>,
under 37 Geo. III. <i>c.</i> 126, should be extended to <i>all</i>
cases of counterfeit money.]</p>

<p>5. The laws peculiarly relating to the <i>Copper Coinage</i>,
although more modern, have also been found to be extremely
defective, and totally inadequate to their object. The Act
of the 11th of his present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">-197-</a></span> Majesty, <i>cap.</i> 40, indeed,
makes it felony to sell Copper Money of the similitude <i>of
the current Money of the Realm</i> at a less value than the
denomination doth import; but the benefit of Clergy not
being taken away, and no specific punishment being
mentioned, the offenders are generally subjected only to a
year's inprisonment, which proves no check whatever, as
their families carry on business in the mean time; and if
they sell <i>plain or evasive Halfpence</i>, or what are called
<i>Irish Harps</i>, or mix them with <i>stamped Half-pence</i>,
similar to the current Coin of the Realm, so that the
stamped Coin does not exceed the value of what the
denomination imports, it is doubtful whether the prosecution
will not fail.</p></div>

<p><span class="hand" title="pointing hand">&#9758;</span> It is submitted, that a statute ought to be framed, declaring it
<i>Felony</i>, punishable by seven years' transportation: 1st. For any
person to make or manufacture any piece of Copper or other metal, with
or without any device whatsoever, with an intent that it shall pass as
the <i>Copper Monies of the Kingdoms of Great Britain or Ireland</i>. 2nd.
For any smith, engraver, founder, &amp;c. or any person, except those
employed in the Mint, or authorized by the Treasury, to make or mend,
buy or sell, conceal or have in their possession, without a lawful
excuse, any puncheon, stamp, die, mould, &amp;c. on which shall be
impressed, or with intent that there shall be impressed on the same,
any resemblance whatever, in part or in the whole, of such <i>Copper
Monies</i>. 3d. For any person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">-198-</a></span> to buy or sell, or offer to buy or sell,
or to utter or tender in payment, or to give or offer to give in
exchange, <i>thirty or more pieces of Copper</i> in any one day; such piece
resembling or being intended to resemble, or passing or being intended
to pass as the current Copper Money of the said kingdoms.</p>

<p>That such proposed statute should also make it a misdemeanor
(punishable by a fine of 40<i>s.</i> for the first offence, £5. for the
second, and £10. for every subsequent offence) for any person to buy,
sell, utter, &amp;c. any number <i>less than thirty</i> of such pieces of
Copper, resembling or intended to resemble or pass, &amp;c. as such
current Copper Money. The fines to be recoverable in a summary way
before one magistrate. This would reach Turnpike-men and others, who
wilfully pass bad Halfpence at one gate which are refused at another:
and would generally check the circulation of base Copper Money, which
has become an evil of great magnitude.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>6. The laws, as they now stand, are silent regarding
Provincial Copper Coin, or what are called <i>Tokens</i>,
representing an Halfpenny. It might perhaps be useful to
legalize <i>Tokens</i> or <i>Provincial Coins</i> on three conditions.
<span class="hand" title="pointing hand">&#9758;</span> <i>1. That the Copper of which they are made shall be
pure.&mdash;2. That this Coin shall be at least 10 per cent.
heavier than Mr. Boulton's new Coinage.&mdash;3. That the parties
circulating such Coin be responsible to the holders, for the
value in Gold or Silver, when demanded: and shall stamp
their names and an obligation to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">-199-</a></span> purpose on the Coins,
Tokens, or Medals so issued by them.</i>&mdash;It would be necessary
under such circumstances that every person, issuing Tokens
or Medals, should take out a Licence for that purpose from
the principal Officers of the Mint, as an authority for such
Coinage: giving security at the same time to observe the
above Conditions.</p></div>

<p>It may, however, be worthy consideration, whether these tokens should
not be wholly suppressed, and the offence of fabricating any Copper
pieces passing, or intended to pass "<i>as, for, or in lieu of</i>" the
lawful Copper Coin, be made felony: and that such tokens should in all
respects be considered as actual Counterfeit Coin, and treated
accordingly: or, at all events, that persons issuing and circulating
such tokens should be liable to a severe penalty; and bound to pay the
holder, on demand, the full denominated value.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>7. The mischievous agents of the Dealers in base Money, <i>the
persons who keep Flatting-mills, and other machinery, for
preparing, and rolling their metals, for being coined into
base Money</i>, are not at present within the reach of
punishment by any existing law. Although by preparing the
metal for the subsequent process of stamping, they are in
fact parties concerned, without whose aid the Coinage of
what are called <i>Flats</i>, or milled money, could not be
carried on.&mdash;The chief difficulty is in punishing persons
for producing an article which may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">-200-</a></span> be turned into coach and
harness ornaments, buttons, and many purposes as well as
base Money.</p></div>

<p><span class="hand" title="pointing hand">&#9758;</span> With respect to this whole tribe of dangerous manufacturers,
whose trade and abilities are so liable to be perverted to iniquitous
purposes, it has been under consideration to regulate them, by
legislative measures, to the following effect: viz. "That no person,
except those employed in the mints, shall erect, set up, or use, or
knowingly have in possession any <i>cutting engine for cutting round
blanks by the force of a screw out of fatted bars or sheets of Copper,
or other metal</i>; or any <i>stamping press, fly, rolling mill, flatting
mill, or other instrument for stamping, flatting, or marking metals</i>,
or <i>which, with the assistance of any matrix, Stamp, or dye, will
stamp or mark Copper or other metals, or prepare the same for stamping
or marking</i>, without first giving notice thereof in writing to persons
authorized to keep an entry and registry thereof, containing the
Christian and Surnames of the owners of such instruments, and
describing the use thereof, and the house or other place in which the
same is intended to be erected, set up, used or kept; and to give the
like notice on any removal, under a certain penalty, recoverable as in
the case of Hair Powder, and other revenue laws."&mdash;It is believed, on
the best authority, that the Licence here proposed (especially as it
would subject the parties to no pecuniary burden) would meet the
approbation of the principal manufacturers, on account of the
facilities which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">-201-</a></span> would afford in detecting and in embarrassing
those who set up machinery for unlawful purposes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>8. No provision is made in any Act against, and consequently
no punishment is inflicted on, the offence of <i>buying base
money to recolour it</i>&mdash;<span class="hand" title="pointing hand">&#9758;</span> This is a modern device, and
may be remedied, as it seems, by enacting&mdash;"That every
person who shall buy, take or receive any blank or round
piece of blanched copper, mixed metal, or metal of any sort
whatsoever, for the purpose of colouring the same, or
causing the same to be coloured, or with intent or knowledge
that the same shall or will be coloured, or which shall have
been coloured, so as to pass for the current Gold or Silver
Coins of Great Britain or Ireland, shall be punishable by a
fine of £.20 and one month's imprisonment; and that any
person who shall buy or sell, or offer to buy or sell any
piece of blanched Copper, &amp;c. which may formerly have passed
as or for such current Gold or Silver Coin, shall be
punishable by a fine of 40<i>s.</i> recoverable in a summary way;
or by one month's imprisonment."&mdash;This last penalty will
reach the Jew Boys, who cry bad shillings, and will prove,
it is hoped, an effectual check by means of a very mild
punishment upon shopkeepers, tradesmen, and others, who
inadvertently sell defaced counterfeit shillings without
reflecting that although they obtain 3<i>d.</i> in this traffick
for what is not intrinsically worth one farthing, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">-202-</a></span>
same counterfeits are again coloured, and received by them
at the full value of 12<i>d.</i></p>

<p>9. No existing law gives any power to Magistrates upon
information on oath, to search for, or seize Counterfeit
Coin of this realm in the custody or possession of <i>known
Dealers</i> or <i>reputed Utterers</i>; although these Dealers and
Utterers are now the persons (and not the actual Coiners)
who keep the base money: neither is there any power to seize
base money conveying in coaches or waggons going into the
country. Under this shelter the Dealers are enabled to hold
markets for sale in their houses, where they frequently keep
large stocks; and base money is also sent into the country
without the least hazard of detection or seizure.</p></div>

<p><span class="hand" title="pointing hand">&#9758;</span> Here again the partial remedy introduced by 37 Geo. III. c. 126,
should be extended and applied.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>10. No power is directly given by any existing law, (not
even by the modern Act last mentioned) though upon the most
pointed information, to search the houses or workshops of
coiners <i>in the night time</i>. Hence it is that <i>detection</i>
becomes so difficult, and the evil increases, because the
law in some measure shields the offenders from discovery.
Since in Lottery offences (which are certainly greatly
inferior in their enormity to Coining) a power is granted to
break open houses in the night-time, surely no reason can be
assigned why treasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">-203-</a></span> offences, in Coining base Money,
should not in this respect be on the same footing. Unless a
positive power is given to search in the night, and suddenly
to force open doors or windows, it will be impossible to
detect the Makers of Cast Money.</p>

<p>11. The act 11 Geo. III. cap. 40. gives a power to
Magistrates to issue their warrants to search for tools and
implements used in the <i>Copper Coinage</i>, (with regard to
Silver or Gold Coinage of this realm no such power is
given); but, what is very singular, <i>no punishment whatever
can be inflicted by any existing law</i> on the owner or
proprietor of such tools for making Copper Money, nor upon
the person in whose house they are found; and if when such
search is made, there should be found only <i>plain</i>
Halfpence, or <i>Irish Harps</i>, or <i>evasive Halfpence</i> or
<i>Farthings, varying in the Stamp</i> in any degree from the
current Coin of the Realm, so as not to be of the exact
similitude, (a practice which has now for some time very
much prevailed) the act in question is defeated; inasmuch as
the crime of felony does not attach to offences short of
Coining <i>Copper Money of the similitude of the current Coin
of the Realm</i>. The Coinage of base Copper therefore goes on
with impunity; because it is owing to the carelessness of
the parties themselves if ever they permit the law to reach
them.</p>

<p>12. The laws now in being give no power to seize Counterfeit
Halfpence; either in the hands of the Dealers, who keep a
kind of open market at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">-204-</a></span> own houses every morning to
supply Jew Boys, who cry bad Shillings, or in those of many
others in various trades, who become the channels of
circulation to a vast extent without risk or inconvenience.
Neither does the statute law authorize the apprehension of
Jew Boys, who go out every morning loaded with counterfeit
Copper, which they exchange for bad shillings.</p></div>

<p><span class="hand" title="pointing hand">&#9758;</span> To remedy this part of the evil, it is proposed, "That on
complaint made to any one Justice of Peace upon oath, that there is
just cause to suspect that any person is concerned in making or using,
or has in their custody any unlawful puncheon, stamp, die, mould, &amp;c.
made for the purpose, or which may be applied to the purpose, of
counterfeiting the Gold, Silver, or Copper Coin of the Kingdoms of
Great Britain or Ireland; or of making or manufacturing any pieces of
metal intended to pass as such coin, or any cutting engine for cutting
round blanks by means of force applied to a screw, or flatted bars of
metal, &amp;c. or any wash or material which will produce the colour of
Gold or silver, or copper, or any round blank of base metal or mixed
metal, or of brass copper, or lead, so as to resemble such coin; or
who hath been concerned in buying, selling, taking in exchange,
receiving, or putting off any Gold, Silver, or Copper Money, not
melted or cut, at a lower rate or value than the same doth import,
such Justice may, by a warrant under his hand, cause the house,
out-house, and other places occupied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">-205-</a></span> such suspected person to be
searched, <i>either by night or by day</i>; and if any of the articles
hereinbefore mentioned, or any counterfeit or pretended coin, blanks,
or round pieces of metal be found, the parties to be seized, and, with
the said articles, brought before a Justice, and such articles may be
afterwards used in evidence, and then broken, defaced, and disposed of
as the Court or Justices shall direct.</p>

<p>"That any Constable, Headborough, or Beadle, and every Watchman, while
on duty, may apprehend and detain all and every person or persons who
may be reasonably suspected of having and carrying, or any ways
conveying for the purpose of selling or trafficking in the same, any
counterfeited or forged Gold, Silver, or Copper Money, whether the
same shall resemble or be intended to resemble, or shall pass or be
intended to pass as and for the coin of the said kingdoms, or of any
foreign Country or State; or having in their possession, without
lawful excuse, any round blanks of base metal or mixed metal, &amp;c. or
any pieces of Gold, Silver, Brass, Copper, or Lead, of a fit size and
figure to be coined, coloured, or converted into Counterfeit Money;
with power also to seize and detain the said Counterfeit Money,
blanks, &amp;c. and convey the same, with the person or persons
apprehended, before one or more Justices; and if the party shall not
give a satisfactory account how the same came into their possession,
or shall not produce the party from whom it was received, he shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, pu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">-206-</a></span>nishable by fine and imprisonment
in a summary manner."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>13. The statute 37 Geo. III. cap. 126. (see <a href="#Page_194">p. 194</a>) has
restrained the evil pointed out in former editions of this
Treatise, respecting the counterfeiting of Foreign Gold and
Silver Coin. It is to be wished, however, that the penalties
imposed on the <i>exportation</i> of such counterfeit Coin by 38
Geo. III. cap. 67, could be further extended and enforced.</p>

<p>14. It must here be repeated, that the great cause of the
defect in the execution of the Laws against Coiners, is the
want of a proper fund for Prosecutions and Rewards, and
other expences for detecting Offenders.&mdash;The acts 7 Anne,
cap. 24, and 15 Geo. II. cap. 28, allow only £.600 for the
expence of prosecutions, which has never been increased for
above half a century; although the offences, as well as the
expence of detection and prosecutions, have increased, at
least, six fold.</p>

<p>15. The reward of £.40, given under the Acts 6 and 7 William
III. cap. 17; 15 Geo. II. cap. 28, is construed to be
limited only to the Conviction of actual Coiners and
Clippers of Gold and Silver; and is not allowed to extend to
colouring and finishing, as well as a number of other
offences connected with <i>making</i>, <i>counterfeiting</i>, and
<i>uttering base</i> Money:&mdash;the reward for Copper Coin is by the
said Act of 15 Geo. II. cap. 28, limited to £.10, and is by
no means a sufficient encouragement to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">-207-</a></span> Officers to do their
duty. <i>It would be a great improvement if a liberal sum were
allowed by Parliament for detections, prosecutions, and
rewards; to be paid on the report of the Judges who try the
offenders, according to the merit and trouble of the
apprehenders, prosecutors, and witnesses; whether there is a
conviction or not.</i></p></div>

<p>The following rewards have been suggested as proper to make part of a
Bill now in a state of preparation, for the general Regulation of the
Coinage: and which is meant to include all the remedies before hinted
at and pointed out: a Legislative measure which must do honour to the
Minister who will carry it into execution.</p>

<p>To be paid without deduction or fee, within one month after such
conviction, on tendering a certificate to the Sheriff.</p>

<p>It is also proposed that the Treasury shall have power to issue out of
the Duties of Customs a sufficient sum of money for prosecuting
offenders against the Mint laws.</p>

<p>Whatever might be the effect of these amendments in the Mint laws, and
necessary as they appear to be, it is still to be feared that until a
new coinage of Silver money and Copper halfpence and farthings shall
take place, no legislative restrictions, regulations, or punishments,
can produce an effectual cure to this enormous evil; although, from
the many deficiencies which have been detailed, it is evident a great
deal of good may be done immediately in this way.</p>

<p>A coinage of Silver money is a great State question, which may require
a fuller consideration; but no doubt can be entertained of the
indispensable necessity of such a measure, as soon as circumstances
will admit.</p>

<p>If to a new coinage of <i>shillings</i> and <i>sixpences</i>, should be added an
extensive coinage of silver money of the value of <i>four pence</i> and
<i>three pence</i>, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">-209-</a></span> to ancient usage, it would prove a great
convenience to the public, and remedy much of the inconvenience which
arises from the ponderous nature of Copper money; while a smaller
quantity would be required for circulation.</p>

<p>No doubt can be entertained of the nation deriving considerable
advantages from having increased the weight of copper coin, so as to
bring it as near as possible to the <i>intrinsic</i> value of the metal of
which it is composed.</p>

<p>This arrangement will, it is hoped, ultimately prove the means of
effectually preventing counterfeits; and the copper, being a native
article produced in the country, may in time, through the medium of
<i>coined money</i>, become a profitable branch of commerce with foreign
nations; where even an extensive circulation may be insured, in
consequence of the <i>intrinsic</i> and <i>denominative</i> value being the
same, or nearly so.</p>

<p>This is exemplified in the policy of Sweden, where the copper dollar
being so heavy as to answer to sixpence sterling, has long been
exported; and forms a considerable, and even a profitable branch of
commerce to that nation.</p>

<p>In Russia the <i>Three Copee Piece</i> is very nearly of the weight of six
English halfpence, yet its current value is only a small fraction
above one penny sterling;&mdash;and thus by issuing no copper coin where
the <i>denominative</i> is not in proportion to the <i>intrinsic</i> value,
every class of dealers who vend the necessaries of life are shielded
against loss; and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">-210-</a></span> unnatural rise in the price of provisions for
the subsistence of the poor is of course prevented.</p>

<p>This principle seems to have been admitted by the Legislature; for
when the subject of Copper Money was under the consideration of the
House of Commons, at a period not very remote, the Journals shew that
an opinion then prevailed, "<i>that the most effectual means to secure
the Copper Coin from being counterfeited, was, that the denominative
value of such Coin should bear as near a proportion as possible to the
intrinsic</i> value of the metal of which it was formed."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>In fine, it is a question worthy of attention, whether in order to
prevent clamour, and to shut out at once all pretence for circulating
any of the old Copper money, <i>good or bad</i>, after the period when Mr.
Boulton shall be able to furnish a sufficient quantity of halfpence
and farthings for circulation, it might not be proper to consider how
far it would be practicable as a measure of State policy, to introduce
a clause into the proposed Bill, empowering the Treasury, within a
given time, to receive all the old Copper Coin, good and bad, at a
certain price per ton, allowing a <i>bonus</i> to the honest holders of it
of 20 per cent. above the current price of Copper.&mdash;This would at once
clear the country of counterfeit halfpence and farthings, and would
reconcile the holders to the loss; while the pecuniary sacrifice to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">-211-</a></span>
Government would be more than compensated an hundred-fold by a
compleat and instant renovation of this species of coinage.&mdash;As the
chief part of the bad halfpence are good copper, they could be
recoined, or sold, as might appear most beneficial.</p>

<p>It is earnestly to be hoped that the further regulations proposed will
be adopted; and followed up, by an extensive coinage of Silver money,
so as to shield the honest part of the Community against a system of
fraud, rapid beyond all example in its growth, and unparalleled as to
its extent.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Certain it is, that base money contributes more to the support as well
as to the <i>increase</i> of the number of those mischievous and abandoned
members of the community, who exist <i>wholly</i> by different kinds of
fraud, than any other device which they pursue to enable them to live
in their present state of idleness and debauchery, and to indulge in
luxury and extravagance.</p>

<p>The increase is certainly astonishing, since it is known that in
London and the Country, there were some time since fifty-four actual
Coiners, and fifty-six large Dealers, besides, at least, ten Die
sinkers, whose <i>names</i>, <i>characters</i>, and pursuits, were perfectly
known; but these bear no proportion to the horde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">-212-</a></span> of smaller dealers
and utterers of base money in the Metropolis, and in most of the
commercial and manufacturing towns in the kingdom. Their numbers must
amount to several thousands. From being at present nuisances to
society, in the constant habit of defrauding the Public, they might be
rendered (through the application of the remedies proposed) useful
members of the State; by changing a life of idleness and crimes, for a
course of useful labour and industry.</p>

<p><span class="cap">T</span>HE immense depredations committed on every species of Commercial
Property in the River Thames, but particularly on West India produce,
had long been felt as a grievance of the greatest magnitude;
exceedingly hurtful to the Commerce and Revenue of the port of London,
and deeply affecting the interest of the Colonial Planters, as well as
every description of Merchants and Ship-Owners concerned in the Trade
of the River Thames.</p>

<p>The subject of this Chapter will therefore be chiefly confined to a
detail of the causes, which produced these extraordinary and extensive
depredations, and the various means by which they were perpetrated;
and also to the remedies which have been successfully applied since
the publication of the preceding editions of this Work, for the
purpose of reducing within bounds, and keeping in check, this enormous
and growing evil; for certain it is, that previous to the
establishment of the Marine Police System, in the Month of July 1798,
the increase had been regular and progressive, while the easy manner
in which this species of property was obtained, generated an accession
of plunderers every year.</p>

<p>To those whose habits of life afford no opportunities of attending to
subjects of this nature, the details which are now to be given will
appear no less novel than extraordinary; and with respect to the
extent of the mischief in some instances perhaps in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">-215-</a></span>credible. The
West India Planters alone have estimated their losses by depredations
upon the River and in the Warehouses at the enormous sum of £.250,000
a year. It cannot be unreasonable then to suppose, that the extent of
the plunder on the other branches of Commerce, which form nearly 5-6th
parts of the whole value of Imports and Exports, could not be less
than £.250,000 more, making an aggregate upon the whole of Half a
Million sterling!<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Surprising as this may appear at first view, yet when, by a cool
investigation of the subject, it comes to be measured by the scale of
the astonishing Commerce which centers in the port of London,
(according to the annexed <a href="#TABLE">Abstract</a>) and the vast extent of Floating
Property moving constantly upon the River Thames, and the adjacent
Wharfs and Quays subject to depredations; when by calculation it is
also found, that the whole amount of the aggregate plunder, great and
extensive as it appears to be, does not much exceed <i>three quarters
per cent.</i> on the value of the whole property exposed to danger: the
Reader will be reconciled to an estimate, which from the elucidations
contained in this chapter, will ultimately appear by no means to be
exaggerated.</p>

<p>Let the mind only contemplate this proud view of the Commerce of a
Single River, unparalleled in point of extent and magnitude in the
whole world; where 13,444 ships and vessels discharge and receive in
the course of a year above three <i>Millions of Packages</i>, many of which
contain very valuable articles of merchandize, greatly exposed to
depredations, not only from the criminal habits of many of the aquatic
labourers and others who are employed, but from the temptations to
plunder, arising from the confusion unavoidable in a crowded port, and
the facilities afforded in the disposal of stolen property.&mdash;It will
then be easily conceived, that the plunder must have been excessive,
especially where from its analogy to smuggling, at least in the
conceptions of those who were implicated; and from its gradual
increase, the culprits seldom were restrained by a sense of the moral
turpitude of the offence; and where for want of a <i>Marine Police</i>
applicable to the object, no means existed whereby offenders could be
detected on the River.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">-218-</a></span></p>

<p>The fact is, that the system of River depredations grew, and ramified
as the Commerce of the Port of London advanced, until at length it
assumed the different forms, and was conducted by the various classes
of delinquents, whose nefarious practices are now to be explained
under their respective heads.</p>

<p>1st. <i>River Pirates.</i>&mdash;This class was generally composed of the most
desperate and depraved characters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">-219-</a></span> who followed aquatic pursuits.
Their attention was principally directed to ships, vessels, and craft
in the night, which appeared to be unprotected; and well authenticated
instances of their audacity are recounted, which strongly prove the
necessity of a vigorous and energetic Police. Among many other
nefarious exploits performed by these miscreants, the following may
suffice to shew to what extent their daring and impudent conduct
carried them.</p>

<p>An American vessel lying at East-lane Tier, was boarded in the night,
while the Captain and crew were asleep, by a gang of River Pirates,
who actually weighed the ship's anchor, and hoisted it into their boat
with a complete new cable, with which they got clear off.&mdash;The Captain
hearing a noise, came upon deck at the moment the villains had secured
their booty, with which they actually rowed away in his presence,
impudently telling him, they had taken away his anchor and cable, and
bidding him good morning. Their resources afforded them means of
immediate concealment. No Police then existed upon the River, and his
property was never recovered.</p>

<p>A similar instance of atrocity occurred about the same time, where the
bower anchor of a vessel from Guernsey was weighed, and, with the
cable, plundered and carried off in the same manner.</p>

<p>Although only these two instances of extraordinary audacity are
specified, others equally bold and daring could be adduced if the
limits of this Work would admit of it. When vessels first arrive in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">-220-</a></span> river, particularly those from the West Indies, they are
generally very much lumbered. Ships in this situation were considered
as the harvest of the River Pirates, with whom it was a general
practice to cut away bags of <i>Cotton</i>, <i>Cordage</i>, <i>Spars</i>, <i>Oars</i>, and
other articles from the quarter of the vessels, and to get clear off,
even in the day time as well as in the night. Before a Police existed
upon the River all classes of aquatic labourers having been themselves
more or less implicated in the same species of criminality, generally
connived at the delinquency of each other, and hence it followed, that
few or none were detected while afloat and the evil became so
extensive.</p>

<p>It was frequently the practice of these River Pirates to go armed, and
in sufficient force to resist, and even to act offensively if they met
with opposition.&mdash;Their depredations were extensive among craft
wherever valuable goods were to be found; but they diminished in
number after the commencement of the war; and now since the
establishment of the Marine Police they have almost totally
disappeared.</p>

<p>On the return of peace, however, if a system of watchful energy is not
maintained, these miscreants must be expected (as on former occasions
on the termination of wars) to renew their iniquitous depredations in
great force, as numbers of depraved characters may then be expected to
be discharged from the Army and Navy.</p>

<p>2d. <i>Night Plunderers.</i>&mdash;These were composed chiefly of the most
depraved class of watermen, who associ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">-221-</a></span>ated together in gangs of four
or five in number, for the purpose of committing depredations on the
cargoes of lighters and other craft employed in conveying goods to the
quays and wharfs. Their practice was to associate themselves with one
or more of the watchmen who were employed to guard these lighters
while cargoes were on board, and by the connivance of these faithless
guardians of the night, to convey away in lug boats every portable
article of merchandize, to which, through this medium, they often had
too easy access.</p>

<p>These corrupt watchmen did not always permit the lighters under their
own charge to be pillaged.&mdash;Their general practice was, to point out
to the leader of the gang those lighters that were without any guard,
and lay near their own, and which, on this account, might be easily
plundered. An hour was fixed on for effecting the object in view. The
Receiver (generally a man of some property) was applied to, to be in
readiness at a certain hour before day-light to warehouse the goods. A
lug boat was seized on for the purpose. The articles were removed into
it out of the lighter, and conveyed to a landing-place nearest the
warehouse of deposit. The watchmen in the streets leading to this
warehouse were bribed to connive at the villainy, often under pretence
that it was a smuggling transaction, and thus the object was effected.</p>

<p>In this precise manner was a quantity of ashes and hemp conveyed in
1798, to the house of an opulent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">-222-</a></span> Receiver. Several other cargoes of
hemp, obtained in the same manner, were conveyed up the river, and
afterwards carted in the day-time to the repositories of the
purchaser, till by the vigilance of the Police Boats, a detection took
place, and the whole scene of mischief was laid open.</p>

<p>This species of depredation went to a great extent, and when it was
considered that the very men who Were appointed to guard property in
this situation were themselves associates in the criminality, and
participated in the profit arising from the booty; and that matters
were so arranged as to secure the connivance of all those who were
appointed to situations with a view to detect and apprehend
delinquents; it ceases to be a matter of wonder, that the plunder in
this particular line was excessive.</p>

<p>In many instances where goods could not be plundered through the
connivance of watchmen, it was no uncommon thing to cut lighters
adrift, and to follow them to a situation calculated to elude
discovery where the pillage commenced. In this manner have whole
lighter loads even of coals been discharged at obscure landing places
upon the river, and carted away during the night.</p>

<p>Even the article of Tallow from Russia, which, from the unwieldiness
of the packages, appears little liable to be an object of plunder, has
not escaped the notice of these offenders: large quantities have been
stolen, and an instance has been stated to the Author, where a lighter
loaded with this article was cut from a ship in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">-223-</a></span> the Pool, and found
next morning with six large casks of tallow stolen, and two more
broken open, and the chief part plundered and carried away. In short,
while the river remained unprotected nothing escaped these marauders.</p>

<p>3d. <i>Light-Horsemen</i>, or Nightly Plunderers of West India ships.&mdash;This
class of depredators for a long period of time had carried on their
nefarious practices with impunity, and to an extent in point of value,
that almost exceeds credibility; by which the West India planters and
merchants sustained very serious and extensive losses.</p>

<p>The practice seems to have originated in a connection which was formed
between the Mates of West India ships<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and the criminal Receivers,
residing near the river, who were accustomed to assail them under the
pretence of purchasing what is called <i>sweepings</i>, or in other words,
the spillings or drainings of sugars, which remained in the hold and
between the decks after the cargo was discharged. These sweepings were
claimed as a perquisite by a certain proportion of the Mates, contrary
to the repeated and express rules established by the Committee of
Merchants, who early saw the evils to which such indulgences would
lead, and in vain attempted to prevent it. The connivance, however, of
the Revenue officers became necessary to get these sweepings on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">-224-</a></span>
shore, and the quantity of spillings were gradually increased year
after year by fraudulent means, for the purpose of satisfying the
rapacity of all whose assistance and collusion was found necessary to
obtain the object in view.</p>

<p>The connection thus formed, and the necessary facilities obtained,
from the sale of sweepings, recourse was at length had to the disposal
of as much of the cargo as could be obtained by a licence to nightly
plunderers, composed of Receivers, Coopers, Watermen, and Aquatic
Labourers, who having made a previous agreement with the Mate and
Revenue Officers, were permitted, on paying from thirty to fifty
guineas, to come on board in the night,&mdash;to open as many hogsheads of
sugar as were accessible,&mdash;and to plunder without controul. For this
purpose, a certain number of bags dyed black, and which went under the
appellation of <i>Black Strap</i>, were provided.&mdash;The Receivers, Coopers,
Watermen, and Lumpers, went on board at the appointed time, for all
these classes were necessary. The hogsheads of sugar and packages of
coffee, &amp;c. were opened; the black bags were filled with the utmost
expedition and carried to the Receivers, and again returned to be
refilled until daylight, or the approach of it, stopped the pillage
for a few hours. On the succeeding night the depredations were again
renewed; and thus, on many occasions, from fifteen to twenty hogsheads
of sugar and a large quantity of coffee, and also in some instances
rum (which was removed by means of a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">-225-</a></span> pump called a Jigger, and
filled into bladders with nozzels,) were plundered in a single ship,
in addition to the excessive depredations which were committed in the
same ships by the Lumpers or labourers who were employed during the
day in the discharge of the cargo.&mdash;Instances have been adduced, and
judicially proved, of various specific ships having been plundered in
an excessive degree in this manner; and it has been estimated upon
credible authority, that previous to the establishment of the Marine
Police, above one-fifth of the whole fleet suffered by nightly
plunder.&mdash;The ships subject to this species of depredation were
generally known from the characters of the Mates or Revenue Officers
who were on board, and were denominated <i>Game Ships</i>, where the
aquatic labourers, called Lumpers, would on every occasion agree to
work without wages, and even solicit their employers to be preferred
on these terms, trusting to a general licence to plunder for their
remuneration.</p>

<p>This nefarious traffic had long been reduced to a regular system. The
mode of negociation necessary to obtain all the requisite advantages
for carrying into execution these iniquitous designs, was not only
perfectly understood, but in most cases, where new Officers were to be
practised upon, a plan of seduction was resorted to which seldom
failed to succeed, when one or more of the old practitioners in this
species of criminality happened to be stationed in the ship.&mdash;In this
particular line of aquatic depredations, (which certainly was the most
mischievous,) scenes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">-226-</a></span> of iniquity have been developed, which, from
their extent and magnitude, could not have been credited had they
stood on any other foundation than that of regular judicial proofs.</p>

<p>4th.&mdash;<i>Heavy Horsemen</i>, otherwise denominated Lumpers of the most
criminal class, who generally selected ships where plunder was most
accessible, either from the criminal connivance of the Mates and
Revenue Officers, in permitting nightly plunder, or from the
carelessness or inattention of these Officers.</p>

<p>This class, many of whom occasionally assisted in the depredations
committed during the night, were exceedingly audacious and depraved.
They generally went on board of West India ships, furnished with
habiliments made on purpose to conceal sugar, coffee, cocoa, pimento,
ginger, and other articles, which they conveyed on shore in great
quantities, by means of an under waistcoat, containing pockets all
round, denominated a <i>Jemie</i>; and also by providing long bags,
pouches, and socks, which were tied to their legs and thighs under
their trowsers.</p>

<p>It is a well-established fact, which does not admit even of the shadow
of a doubt, that these miscreants, during the discharge of what they
called a <i>Game Ship</i>, have been accustomed to divide from three to
four guineas a-piece every night from the produce of their plunder,
independent of the hush-money paid to Officers and others, for
conniving at their nefarious practices.</p>

<p>Long habituated to this species of depredation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">-227-</a></span> they became at length
so audacious, that it was found extremely difficult to controul them
where a disposition existed to protect the cargo from pillage, and
where no seduction had taken place.&mdash;And indeed, so adroit had this
class of Lumpers become, that no ship escaped plunder in a certain
degree, wherever they were employed, in spite of the greatest
vigilance and attention on the part of many of the shipmasters.</p>

<p>5th. <i>Game Watermen</i>, so denominated from the circumstance of their
having been known to hang upon West India ships under discharge for
the whole of the day, in readiness to receive and instantly convey on
shore <i>bags of sugar</i>, <i>coffee</i> and <i>other articles</i>, pillaged by the
Lumpers and others in the progress of the delivery of the cargo, by
which they acquired a considerable booty; as they generally on such
occasions were employed to dispose of the stolen articles, under
pretence of their being a part of the private adventures of the crew,
for which service they usually pocketed one moiety of the price
obtained.&mdash;It was by such assistance that Mates, Boatswains,
Carpenters, Seamen, and Ship Boys, have been seduced, and even taught
to become plunderers and thieves, who would otherwise have remained
honest and faithful to the trust reposed in them. Many of the watermen
of this class were accustomed to live in a style of expence by no
means warranted, from the fair earnings of honest industry in the line
of their profession.&mdash;An instance has been known of an apprentice lad
in this line having kept both a mistress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">-228-</a></span> and a riding horse out of
the profits of his delinquency.</p>

<p>6th. <i>Game Lightermen.</i>&mdash;This class, which is composed of the working,
or Journeymen Lightermen, who navigate the craft which convey West
India produce and other merchandize from the ships to the quays, are,
with some exceptions, extremely loose in their morals, and are ever
ready to forward depredations by the purchase or concealment of
articles of considerable value, until an opportunity offers of
conveying the property on shore. Many of these Lightermen, previous to
the establishment of the Marine Police, were in the constant habit of
concealing in the lockers of their lighters, <i>sugar</i>, <i>coffee</i>,
<i>pimento</i>, <i>ginger</i>, &amp;c. which they received from Mates, and other
persons on board of West India ships.&mdash;These lockers are generally
secured by a padlock; they are calculated to hold and conceal
considerable quantities of goods, whether stolen or smuggled, which
were seldom taken out until after the discharge of the lighter, unless
in certain instances where skiffs attended them.&mdash;When completely
unladen, the practice has been to remove to the road where empty craft
usually lies a-breast of the Custom-house quay, and then carry away
the stolen or smuggled articles&mdash;and it has not seldom happened that
many of these Lightermen have, under pretence of watching their own
lighters while laden at the quays, or in connivance with the Watchmen
selected by themselves, actually plundered the goods under their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">-229-</a></span>
charge to a very considerable amount, without detection.</p>

<p>Nor does it appear that the nefarious practices of these Lightermen
have been confined to West Indian produce alone. Their criminal
designs were directed to almost every species of merchandize placed
under their charge; and the tricks and devices to which they were
accustomed to resort, clearly evinced that their plans for obtaining
pillage had long been systematized, and that they seldom permitted any
opportunity whereby they could profit by making free with property
under their charge to escape their attention. As a proof that this
assertion is well grounded, the following authenticated case, among
others which could be detailed, is stated as an instance of the
extreme rapacity of this class of men.&mdash;A Canada merchant, who had
been accustomed to ship quantities of oil annually to the London
market, finding (as indeed almost every merchant experiences) a
constant and uniform deficiency in the quantity landed, greatly
exceeding what could arise from common leakage, which his
correspondents were quite unable to explain; having occasion to visit
London, was resolved to see his cargo landed with his own eyes; so as,
if possible, to develope a mystery heretofore inexplicable, and by
which he had regularly lost a considerable sum for several years.
Determined therefore to look sharp after his property, he was in
attendance at the wharf in anxious expectation of a lighter which had
been laden with his oil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">-230-</a></span> on the preceding day; and which, for reasons
that he could not comprehend, did not get up for many hours after the
usual time.</p>

<p>On her arrival at the wharf, the proprietor was confounded to find the
whole of his casks stowed in the lighter with their bungs downwards.
Being convinced that this was the effect of design, he began now to
discover one of the causes at least, of the great losses he had
sustained; he therefore attended the discharge of the lighter until
the whole of the casks were removed, when he perceived a great
quantity of oil leaked out, and in the hold of the vessel, which the
Lightermen had the effrontery to insist was their perquisite. The
proprietor ordered casks to be brought, and filled no less than nine
of them with the oil that had thus leaked out. He then ordered the
ceiling of the lighter to be pulled up, and found between her timbers
as much as filled five casks more; thus recovering from a single
lighter-load of his property, no less than fourteen casks of oil,
that, but for his attendance, would have been appropriated to the use
of the Lightermen; who, after attempting to rob him of so valuable a
property, complained very bitterly of his ill usage in taking it from
them.</p>

<p>7th. <i>Mud-Larks</i>, so called from their being accustomed to prowl
about, at low water, under the quarters, of West India ships; (or at
least that class which were denominated <i>Game</i>, these being mostly the
objects of pillage;) under pretence of grubbing in the mud for <i>old
ropes</i>, <i>iron</i>, and <i>coals</i>, &amp;c. but whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">-231-</a></span> chief object, when in such
situations, was to receive and conceal small bags of sugar, coffee,
pimento, ginger, and other articles, and sometimes bladders containing
rum, which they conveyed to such houses as they were directed, and for
which services they generally received a share of the booty.&mdash;These
auxiliaries in this species of pillage were considered as the lowest
cast of thieves; but from a general knowledge of the Receivers in the
vicinity, they frequently afforded considerable assistance to the
Lumpers, Coopers and others, who collected plunder in the progress of
the ships' delivery.</p>

<p>8th. <i>Revenue Officers.</i>&mdash;Notwithstanding the laudable severity of the
Commissioners of his Majesty's Customs and Excise, in making examples
of their inferior servants by immediate dismission, on proof made of
any offence, or even neglect of duty; a certain class of these
officers, who are denominated <i>Game</i>, have found means to promote
pillage to a very extensive degree, not only in West India ships, but
also in ships from the East Indies, and in every ship and vessel
arriving and departing from the River Thames, of which it is to be
lamented, that too many proofs have been adduced. This class of
officers generally make a point of at least having the appearance of
being punctual and regular in their attendance upon their duty, and by
never being found absent by their superior officers obtain
preferences, where such can be given, with respect to those
par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">-232-</a></span>ticular ships which afford the best harvest, either from being
under the charge of Mates or others, with whom they have had criminal
transactions in former voyages, or from the cargo being of a nature
calculated to afford a resource for plunder. They are also generally
acquainted with the <i>Copemen</i> or Receivers, with whom and the other
officers, after seducing the Mate, (if not already seduced) they
negociate for the purchase of whatever can be plundered.</p>

<p>In those seasons of the year, when the crouded state of the port
renders it necessary to have recourse to <i>extra</i> and <i>Glut Officers</i>,
the general distress of this class of men, and the expectations most
of them have formed of advantages by being placed on board ships of a
certain description, render it an easy matter to seduce them; and by
such means had every obstruction been removed to the perpetration of
these excessive robberies, in all their ramifications, which had so
long afflicted the port of London.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">-233-</a></span></p>

<p>9th. <i>Scuffle-Hunters</i>&mdash;so denominated probably from their resorting
in numbers to the quays and wharfs where goods are discharging, under
pretence of finding employment as labourers upon the landing places
and in the warehouses, and from the circumstance, of <i>disputes</i> and
<i>scuffles</i> arising about who should secure most plunder from broken
packages. This class of men, who may fairly be considered as the very
scum of society, frequently prowl about with long aprons, not so much
with a view to obtain employment, as for the purpose of availing
themselves of the confusion which the crowded state of the quays often
exhibits, and the opportunity of obtaining plunder; in which object
they have too frequently been successful, particularly when admitted
into the warehouses as labourers, where they have found means to
pilfer and carry away considerable quantities of sugar and other
articles, in which they were not a little countenanced, by similar
offences committed by journeymen coopers and others, who, under the
colour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">-234-</a></span> sanctioned perquisites, abstract considerable quantities of
sugar, thereby subjecting the proprietors to an accumulated loss: for,
in addition to the first cost or price of the article, the duties
which have been paid form no inconsiderable part of the ultimate
value. It is only necessary to resort to the Journals of the House of
Commons, and the Appendix to the Report of the Dock Committee in 1796,
in order to be satisfied, that the plunder in the warehouses has been
excessive. And if credit is to be given to the evidence then brought
forward, and also to the affidavits of persons, who have worked for
many years in the sugar warehouses, the loss sustained on an
importation of 140,000<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> casks of sugar has not fallen much short of
£.100,000 a year.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">-235-</a></span></p>

<p>10th. <i>Copemen or Receivers of Stolen Commercial Property.</i>&mdash;This
mischievous class of men may be considered as the chief movers and
supporters of the extensive scene of iniquity which has been developed
and explained in the preceding pages of this Chapter. They were
heretofore extremely numerous, and divided into various classes.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
Those denominated <i>Copemen</i> formed the junto of wholesale dealers, who
were accustomed to visit ships on their arrival, for the purpose of
entering into contract with such Revenue Officers or Mates as they had
formerly known or dealt with, and such others as they could by means
of friendly officers seduce to their views.</p>

<p>Their negociations were carried on in a language and in terms peculiar
to themselves; and commenced by settling the price of</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="goods">
<tr><td><i>Sand</i></td><td class="center">by which, in their cant language, was meant</td><td><i>Sugar</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Beans</i></td><td class="center">or</td><td><i>Coffee</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Pease</i></td><td class="center">&mdash;</td><td><i>Pimento</i> or <i>Pepper</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Vinegar</i></td><td class="center">&mdash;</td><td><i>Rum</i> and <i>other Liquors</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Malt</i></td><td class="center">&mdash;</td><td><i>Tea</i>.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It was their custom to afford assistance wherever such articles were
to be procured by providing <i>Black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">-236-</a></span> Straps</i>, (<i>i.e.</i>, the long black
bags already mentioned) to contain sugar, and calculated to stow
easily in the bottom of boats, without being discovered on account of
the colour. They also procured bladders with wooden nozels for the
purpose of containing rum, brandy, geneva, and other liquors, and
furnished boats to convey the plunder from the ships during the night.</p>

<p>Some of these Receivers had acquired considerable sums of money by
their nefarious traffic, and were able to tempt and seduce those who
would permit them to plunder the cargo, by administering to their
wants by considerable advances of money which, however, rarely
amounted to a moiety of the value of the goods obtained, and
frequently not 1-4th part, particularly in the article of Coffee.</p>

<p>Other classes of Receivers purchased from the Lumpers, Coopers, &amp;c.
after the property was landed, and being generally engaged in business
as small grocers or keepers of chandlers' shops, and old iron and junk
warehouses, they were accustomed to protect it in its transit, from
one criminal dealer to another, by means of false bills of parcels.</p>

<p>It would fill a volume to recount the various ramifications of this
nefarious traffic, and the devices used to defeat Justice and elude
the punishment of the Law.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">-237-</a></span></p>

<p>It extended to almost every article imported into, and exported from,
the port of London. But the dealings in stolen West India produce were
by far the most extensive; at the same time it appears from recent
investigation, that the <i>East India Company</i> and the <i>Russian</i> and
<i>American Merchants</i>, as well as the Importers of <i>Timber</i>, <i>Ashes</i>,
<i>Furs</i>, <i>Skins</i>, <i>Oil</i>, <i>Provisions</i> and <i>Corn</i>, were also
considerable sufferers. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">-238-</a></span> Coal Merchants have likewise sustained
losses to a great amount annually, while every species of goods
imported have been more or less subject to depredations.</p>

<p>Nor has the Export Trade on the River Thames been in any respect
secured against the rapacity of this phalanx of plunderers. Many
well-authenticated cases have recently been developed, which prove
that Hamburgh vessels outward bound, have been plundered to a
considerable amount,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> particularly those which were laden with
sugar, coffee, and other West India produce. Outward-bound ships to
every part of the world have also been more or less objects of
plunder, to the numerous herds of delinquents who were employed upon
the River, aided by their associates in iniquity, the Receivers.</p>

<p>To enter <i>into particulars</i>, or to detail specific instances, would
far exceed the limits prescribed for this branch of the general
catalogue of delinquency exhibited in this Work. Suffice it to say,
that the most satisfactory evidence can be adduced, that the system of
depredation which had so long prevailed, and which had advanced with
the growing Commerce of the Port, had pervaded every species of
Merchan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">-239-</a></span>dize laden or discharged, as well as the Tackle, Apparel and
Stores of almost every ship and vessel arriving in, and departing
from, the River Thames.</p>

<p>Nor can it be a matter of wonder, that such pervading mischiefs should
have prevailed when it is known, that above 5000 individuals, employed
in various stationary situations upon the River, have, with a very few
exceptions, been nursed from early life in acts of delinquency of this
nature.</p>

<p>In a group so extensive there are unquestionably many different shades
of turpitude; but certain it is, that long habit, and general example,
had banished from the minds of the mass of the culprits implicated in
these offences, that sense of the criminality of the action, which
attaches to every other species of theft.</p>

<hr class="dbl1" />
<hr class="dbl2" />

<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> was the situation of things in the Port of London, in the month
of July 1798, when the <span class="smcap">Marine Police Institution</span>, a wise and salutary
measure of Government, arose from the meritorious exertions of the
West India Merchants.</p>

<p>The object of this Establishment was to counteract these mischievous
proceedings, and by salutary arrangements <i>in the Science of Police</i>
to prevent in future a repetition of those crimes which had so long
contaminated the morals of the people, and operated as an evil of no
small weight and magnitude on the Trade of the River Thames.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">-240-</a></span></p>

<p>How far this System, <i>planned</i> and adapted to the exigencies of the
case, and carried into effort by the Author of these pages, assisted
by a very able and indefatigable Magistrate, and by many zealous and
active Officers, has been productive of the benefits which were in
contemplation, must be determined by an accurate examination of the
state of delinquency, among the aquatic labourers and others, employed
at present in ships and vessels in the River Thames; compared with
what existed previous to this Establishment, as detailed in the
preceding pages of this Chapter.</p>

<p>Although much yet remains to be done to prevent the renewal of those
criminal proceedings, which have by great exertions been happily in
many instances suppressed.&mdash;Although the Marine Police<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> has been
unquestionably crippled by the want of those apposite <i>Legislative</i>
Regulations, upon which its energy and utility, as a <i>permanent
Establishment</i>, must, in a great measure depend, yet the proofs of the
advantages which have resulted from it, not only to the West India
Trade<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> (for the protection of which it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">-241-</a></span> originally instituted)
but also to the whole Commerce and Navigation of the Port of London,
are so decided and irrefragable, that specific details are
unnecessary, especially since Deputations of the most respectable
Merchants from the whole Commercial Body, sensible of the benefits
derived from the system have solicited the sanction of Government, for
the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">-242-</a></span> passing a Bill to extend the design, so as to afford
the same protection to the general Trade of the Port, which has been
experienced by the West India Planters and Merchants;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and
requesting to be permitted to defray the expence by an annual
assessment upon the Trade.</p>

<p>It may only be necessary in this place to state, that under all the
disadvantages and difficulties attending the execution of this design,
it may truly be said to have worked wonders in reforming the shocking
abuses which prevailed.&mdash;<i>The River Pirates do not now exist in any
shape.&mdash;The Nightly Plunderers, denominated Light Horsemen, have not
dared in a single instance to pursue their criminal designs.&mdash;The
Working Lumpers, denominated Heavy Horse, are no longer to be found
loaded with Plunder.</i>&mdash;Watermen are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">-243-</a></span> not now as <i>formerly to be
recognized in clusters hanging upon the bows and quarters of West
India ships under discharge to receive plunder</i>.&mdash;Lightermen, <i>finding
nothing to be procured by attending their craft, are accustomed to
desert them until the period when they are completely
laden.&mdash;Journeymen Coopers do not wilfully demolish casks and packages
as heretofore, since no advantage is to be reaped from the spillings
of sugar, coffee, or other articles.&mdash;The Mud-Larks find it no longer
an object to prowl about ships at low water while under discharge,
since the resource for that species of iniquitous employment, which
they were accustomed to solicit, is no longer in existence.&mdash;The
criminal class of Revenue Officers, who had long profited (in many
instances to an enormous extent) by the nefarious practices which
prevailed, have not been able to suppress their rage against the New
Police, by the vigilance of which they feel themselves deprived of the
means of profiting by the system of plunder, which they had so
perfectly organized, and which, in collusion with the Revenue
Watermen, they were so well able to cover by availing themselves of
their official situations, on many occasions, in protecting to the
houses of the Receivers articles which were both stolen and smuggled</i>.</p>

<p>By means of a Police Guard upon the Quays, which forms a collateral
branch of the General System, <i>the Scuffle-hunters and Long-apron-men,
who were accustomed to prowl about for the purpose of pillage, have in
a great measure deserted the quays and landing-places; while the
Copemen and Receivers, find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">-244-</a></span>ing from several examples which have been
made, that their former infamous pursuits cannot be continued without
the most imminent hazard, have, in many instances, declined business,
while not a few of these mischievous members of society have quitted
their former residences, and disappeared</i>.</p>

<p>Such has been the effect of the remedy which has been applied towards
the core of the enormous evil of River Plunder.</p>

<p>It is not, however, to be understood that this System has entirely
eradicated the pillage which prevailed, a circumstance not to be
expected, since the design was partial and limited in its nature, and
only intended for the protection of West India property, although very
extensive benefits have unquestionably arisen from its collateral
influence, and its energy, in terrifying thieves of every description
upon the River, and diminishing their depredations, which, but for the
dread of detection by means of the Police Boats in the night, would
unquestionably have been committed.</p>

<p>But while it is readily admitted that amidst the opposite attractions
of pleasure and pain, it is impossible to reduce the tumultuous
activity of such a phalanx of individuals to absolute order and
purity, who have been in many instances reared up in habits of
delinquency. And while it is a vain hope to expect that crimes can be
totally annihilated, where temptations assail the idle and the
dissolute, and religion and morality, or even in many instances, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">-245-</a></span>
fear of punishment, does not operate as a restraint;&mdash;yet is it,
notwithstanding, clear to demonstration, from the effects produced by
the limited experiment which has been made, that the General Police
for the River Thames which is in contemplation, aided by the apposite
Legislative regulations which experience has suggested to be
necessary,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> must in its operation, under the guidance of an able
and active Magistracy, so far diminish and keep down the depredations
which were committed, as to prove scarce a drop in the bucket, when
compared to the extensive and enormous evils which it has been the
object of the promoters of this new System to suppress.</p>

<p>Although in this arduous pursuit, the Author of this work has
experienced infinite difficulties and discouragements, yet is he
rewarded by the consciousness that he was engaged in an undertaking in
which the best interests of Society were involved:&mdash;that independent
of the pecuniary benefits derived by the State, and the Proprietors of
Commercial Property (which already have unquestionably been very
extensive,) he has been instrumental in bringing forward a great
preventive System, and by administering the Laws in conjunction with a
very zealous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">-246-</a></span> able, and humane Magistrate,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> in a manner rather
calculated to <i>restrain</i> than to <i>punish</i>,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> a multitude of
individuals, together with a numerous offspring, are likely to be
rendered useful members of the Body Politic, instead of nuisances in
Society.&mdash;The advantages thus gained (although his labours have been
in other respects gratuitous,) will abundantly compensate the
<i>dangers</i>, the <i>toils</i>, and the anxieties which have been experienced.
In the accomplishment of this object, both the interests of <i>humanity</i>
and <i>morality</i>, have been in no small degree promoted: unquestionably,
there cannot be a greater act of benevolence to mankind, in a course
of <i>criminal delinquency</i>, than that which tends to <i>civilize their
manners</i>;&mdash;<i>to teach them obedience to the</i> Laws;&mdash;<i>to screen
themselves and their families from the evils and distress attendant on
punishment, by preventing the commission of crimes</i>; and <i>to lead them
into the paths of honest industry, as the only means of securing that
real comfort and happiness which a life of criminality, however
productive of occasional supplies of money, can never bestow</i>.&mdash;If it
shall be considered (as it certainly is) a glorious atchievement to
subdue a powerful Army or Navy, and thereby secure the tranquillity of
a State&mdash;is not the triumph in some degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">-247-</a></span> analogous, where a
numerous army of delinquents, carrying on a species of warfare no less
noxious, if not equally hostile, shall not only be subdued by a mild
and systematic direction of the powers of the Law; but that the
conquered enemy shall be converted into an useful friend, adding
strength instead of weakness to the Government of the country?</p>

<p>Such has been, at least, the result of the partial operations of the
Marine Police; and such will unquestionably be the issue of the
general measures which have been planned and arranged, when the
<i>Key-stone</i> shall be finally laid to the fabric, by passing into a Law
the Bill which has been prepared for the extension of this design to
the protection of the whole trade of the port of London.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p><span class="cap">U</span>NDER the pressure of those accumulated wrongs, which constitute the
extensive frauds, embezzlements, pillage, and plunder, known and
acknowledged to exist in the Dock-Yards and other Public Repositories,
it is not easy, at first view, to assign a reason for that apparent
supineness, on the part of men of known honour and integrity, who have
heretofore presided, and who now preside at the Public Boards, in not
using the means necessary to remedy so great an evil.</p>

<p>This may possibly be accounted for, by the extreme difficulty which
men, constantly occupied in a laborious business, find in pursuing
inquiries, or forming arrangements, out of their particular sphere;
more especially when such arrangements require those powers of
business, and that species of legal and general information, which do
not usually attach to men whose education and habits of life have run
in a different channel.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, it is scarcely to be wondered at, that
greater efforts have not been used, (for great efforts are
unquestionably necessary,) to correct those abuses, which have long
existed; and which have been progressively increasing; by means of
which, not only the property of the Public suffers a vast annual
diminution by frauds and embezzlements, but the foundation of all
morals is sapped; and the most baneful practices extend even to men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">-251-</a></span>
in the upper and middle ranks of Society, who are too seldom
restrained by any correct principle of rectitude in transactions,
where the interest of Government only is concerned; either in the
supplying, or afterwards in the taking charge of the custody of Public
Stores.</p>

<p>When the object in view is to acquire money, the power of example,
sanctioned by usage and custom, will reconcile men by degrees, to
enormities and frauds which at first could not have been
endured.&mdash;Acting under this influence, it too often happens that a
distinction is made, as regards moral rectitude, in the minds of many
individuals, between <i>the property of the Nation</i>, and <i>private
property</i>.&mdash;While the most scrupulous attention to the rules of honour
prevails in the latter case, principles, the most relaxed, are yielded
to in the former.</p>

<p>And thus it is, that in such situations, inferior agents also, induced
by example, become insensibly reconciled to every species of fraud,
embezzlement, and peculation.</p>

<p>It is no inconsiderable source of the evil, that large gratuities are
given, under the colour of fees,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> to those who can assist in
promoting the views of the fraudulent, or in guarding them against
detec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">-252-</a></span>tion.&mdash;What was at first considered as the wages of turpitude,
at length assumes the form, and is viewed in the light of a fair
perquisite of office.</p>

<p>In this manner abuses multiply, and the ingenuity of man is ever
fertile in finding some palliative.&mdash;Custom and example sanction the
greatest enormities: which at length become fortified by immemorial
and progressive usage: it is no wonder, therefore, that the superior
Officers find it an Herculean labour to cleanse the Augean stable.</p>

<p>A host of interested individuals opposes them. The task is irksome and
ungracious. The research involves in it matter of deep concern,
affecting the peace, comfort, and happiness of old servants of the
Crown or the Public, and their families; who have not perhaps been
sufficiently rewarded for their services; and who, but for such
perquisites, could not have acquired property, or even supported
themselves with decency.</p>

<p>It is an invidious task to make inquiries, or to impose regulations
which may ultimately affect the interest or the character of
dependants, who have heretofore, perhaps, been regarded as objects of
partiality or affection. Those whose duty it is to superintend the
departments, knowing their own purity, are unwilling to believe that
the same principle of rectitude does not regulate the conduct of
others in inferior situations: and matters, of apparently greater
importance, constantly forcing themselves upon their attention, the
consideration of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">-253-</a></span> abuses is generally postponed: while those who
detect or complain of their existence, seldom meet with much
encouragement; unless some specific act of criminality is stated, and
then it is referred, as a matter of course, to the proper Law
Officers.</p>

<p>These circumstances, however, only prove the necessity of some other
and more effectual agency to remove an evil, which (if the assertions
of those whose efficient situations give them access to the very best
information as to its extent and enormity are correct) <i>is of the
greatest magnitude</i>, and calls aloud for immediate attention.</p>

<p>To understand how this is to be accomplished, it will be necessary in
the first instance to develope the means which are employed to commit
these <i>abuses</i>, <i>frauds</i>, and <i>embezzlements</i>.&mdash;Then to take a general
view of the property exposed to depredation, and afterwards to examine
the nature and effect of the Laws and regulations now in being for the
purpose of preventing these evils; and last of all, to suggest
remedies.</p>

<p>The abuses, frauds, and embezzlements, are multifarious, and are
perpetrated through the medium of a vast variety of agencies, which
naturally divide themselves into two distinct branches.</p>

<p>The first relates to frauds committed by the connivance and assistance
of Clerks, Store-keepers, and inferior officers in the Dock-yards, and
other repositories, and in ships of war and transports; in <i>receiving
and delivering Naval, Victualling, and Ordnance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">-254-</a></span> stores;&mdash;in
surveys;&mdash;in returns of unserviceable stores;&mdash;in</i> what is called
<i>solving off stores;&mdash;in fraudulent certificates;&mdash;in the sale of old
stores</i>; and innumerable other devices; by which a number of
individuals are enriched at the Public expence; and a system of
plunder is supported by fraudulent documents and vouchers of articles
which have no existence but upon paper.</p>

<p>The second branch relates to the actual pillage of <i>new and old
Cordage, Bolts of Canvas, Sails, Bunting, Twine of all sorts,
Fearnought and Kersey, Leather and Hides, old and new Copper, Locks,
Hinges and Bolts, Copper Bolts and Nails in immense quantities,
Bar-Iron, old Iron, Lead and Solder, Ship's-Plank, Oars, Timber of
small sizes, Blocks, Quarterstuff, Candles, Tallow, Oil, Paint, Pitch,
Tar, Turpentine, Varnish, Rosin, Beer and Water Casks, Iron Hoops,
Biscuit Bags, Beer, Bread, Wine, Brandy, Rum, Oil, Vinegar, Butter,
Cheese, Beef, Pork, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;All these articles suffer a vast annual
diminution, by means of that plunder which has become habitual to a
number of the inferior servants of the Crown, who have in their
respective situations, access to such stores.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>This species of plunder is much encouraged by the difficulty of
detection: Vast quantities are con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">-255-</a></span>stantly provided, and the
store-houses are generally full; it happens therefore as a matter of
course, that the articles which were recently deposited are issued
first; and hence many valuable stores, it is said, have remained
untouched and unseen for forty or fifty years, until a number of
articles perish or become unserviceable from length of time.&mdash;An
annual inventory, upon the plan suggested at the close of this
Chapter, rendered practicable by more extensive store-houses, would
remove this obvious inconvenience.</p>

<p>All stores being delivered under the authority of warrants signed by
the Commissioners and proper officers, the clerks, or in their absence
the foreman of the warehouses, where the articles stated in the
warrants are deposited, deliver the stores; and, if opportunities
offer, large additional quantities are said to be frequently sent out,
by the connivance of the inferior officers; sometimes stores are even
delivered two or three times over, under colour of the same warrant,
without discovery.</p>

<p>A similar System prevails with regard to stores sent to the public
repositories from dismantled ships of war and transports.</p>

<p>Many vessels in the coasting trade, and even ships of foreign nations,
it is said, touch at Portsmouth and Plymouth, merely for the purpose
of purchasing <i>cheap stores</i>;&mdash;and it is well known, that many dealers
in naval stores in the neighbourhood of the Dock-Yards are chiefly
supplied in this way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">-256-</a></span></p>

<p>The plan which prevails at present with regard to the sale of old
stores, not only proves a kind of safeguard to these fraudulent
dealers; but is also in itself subject to great abuses, from the
delivery of larger quantities than are actually included in the public
sales, by which the parties concerned are said frequently to pocket
considerable sums of money.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The artificers in the Dock-yards, availing themselves of their
perquisite of Chips, not only commit great frauds, by often cutting up
useful timber, and wasting time in doing so; but also in frequently
concealing, within their bundles of chips, copper bolts, and other
valuable articles, which are removed by their wives and children,
(and, as has appeared in judicial evidence, by boys retained for the
purpose) and afterwards sold to itinerant Jews, or to the dealers in
old iron and stores, who are always to be found in abundance wherever
the Dock-yards are situated.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">-257-</a></span></p>

<p>The Naval, Victualing, and Ordnance Stores pillaged in the Dock-yards
and other public Repositories, and also from ships of war, transports,
and navy and victualing hoys, in the River Thames, and Medway, must
amount to a very large sum annually. The detections, particularly in
the victualing hoys and transports, since the establishment of the
Marine Police, prove the existence of the evil, and the wide field
which it embraces.</p>

<p>The vicinity of the Metropolis;&mdash;the assistance afforded by old iron
and store shops on the spot;&mdash;by carts employed <i>in this trade alone</i>,
constantly going and coming from and to the Capital;&mdash;by the advantage
of an easy and safe conveyance for ponderous and heavy articles, in
lighters and other craft pas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">-258-</a></span>sing up and down the River; and the
extensive chain of criminal connection, at every town and village on
the Thames and Medway, which a course of many years has formed, joined
to the ease with which frauds are committed, have combined to render
this nefarious traffic a very serious and alarming evil.</p>

<p>Among the multitude of persons concerned in it, some are said to keep
men constantly employed in untwisting the cordage, for the purpose of
removing the King's mark, or coloured stran, which is introduced into
it as a check against fraud; while others (as has been already
noticed) are, in like manner, employed in knocking the Broad Arrow out
of copper bolts, nails, bar iron, and other articles, on which it is
impressed, so as to elude detection.</p>

<p>It is scarcely to be credited, to what an extent the sale of the
cordage, sail-cloth, and other Naval articles, including victualing
stores, thus plundered, is carried, in supplying coasting vessels and
smaller craft upon the River Thames, at a cheap rate.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>If the actual value of stores deposited at the different Dock-yards
and public Repositories in the course of a year, is to be considered
as a rule whereby a judgment may be formed of the extent of the losses
sustained by frauds, plunder, and embezzlement, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">-259-</a></span> will be found to
be very erroneous, since a large proportion of what forms the great
aggregate loss sustained annually by Government, does not arise from
the actual stealing of stores, but from frauds committed in
fabricating documents both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Reasons have already been assigned, why many individuals reconcile
their minds to devices, whereby they may be suddenly enriched at the
Public expence, who would be shocked at the idea of over-reaching an
individual. For the purpose, therefore, of estimating truly the
probable extent of the evil, a general view must not only be taken of
the Naval, Victualing, Ordnance, and other Stores at all times
deposited in the Public Arsenals, but also the stores and provisions
on board of the numerous ships of war, and transports, constantly
consuming and replacing in all quarters of the Globe; and to measure
the whole by the great annual expence, which is incurred in this
necessary service, <i>The Bulwark of Britain, and the Glory and Pride of
the Nation</i>.</p>

<p>Looking at the subject in this point of view, where the ramifications
are so extensive, and the opportunities so numerous, whereby in the
hurry and confusion of carrying on a most important public service,
frauds and embezzlements may be committed with impunity, the question
is, Whether measures are not practicable, whereby the public loss, by
the rapacity of individuals, may not lie greatly diminished, and what
system would be best adapted to the attainment of this object?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">-260-</a></span></p>

<p>To illustrate this proposition it may be necessary to form an
estimate, in the first instance, of the stationary and floating
property belonging to his Majesty, in the different Public Arsenals
and ships of War.&mdash;The following statement is hazarded with this
particular view, not as an accurate detail of facts; for accuracy to a
point under the present circumstances is neither practicable nor
absolutely necessary. It is sufficient if it tends to elucidate and
explain an important point, on the subject of the frauds and
depredations committed on the public stores, which would not be
otherwise intelligible or useful to the public, to the extent which
the Author contemplates.&mdash;</p>

<p>The annual pecuniary Supplies for the Navy may be estimated at
<i>Thirteen Millions a year</i> during war; of which sum about <i>Six
Millions</i> may be applicable to the pay of the Officers and Seamen, and
<i>Seven Millions</i> to <i>Ships-Stores, Provisions, &amp;c.</i> The last two,
namely, the stores and provisions being in a constant state of
movement, both at home and abroad, furnish abundant resource for
frauds and depredations, which may certainly be greatly diminished,
though perhaps impracticable to be eradicated entirely.</p>

<p>The object, therefore, is to devise means whereby this <i>diminution</i>
may be accomplished: and in pursuing this important inquiry, it will
be necessary to precede it by the following general view of the Laws
now in being, which relate to offences committed in the Naval and
other Public Departments.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Acts of the 31st of Elizabeth, (cap. 4.) and the 22d of
Charles II. (cap. 5.) made it felony, without Benefit of
Clergy, to steal or embezzle any of his Majesty's Military
or Naval Stores or Provisions, above the value of Twenty
Shillings.</p>

<p>By the 9 and 10 of William III. (cap. 41.) the Receivers of
embezzled stores, or such as should have the same in their
custody, are subject to a penalty of £.200.</p>

<p>From this period, till the 1st of George the First, the
attention of the Legislature does not seem to have been
directed to this object; when by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">-262-</a></span> statute, 1st Geo. I.
stat. 2. cap. 25, the principal Officers or Commissioners of
the Navy were authorized to issue warrants to search for
Public Property stolen or embezzled, and to punish the
Offenders by fine or imprisonment.</p>

<p>A succeeding Act, (9 Geo. I. cap. 8.) empowered the Judges
to mitigate the fine of £.200 imposed on persons having in
their possession public stores, and to punish the offenders
corporally, by causing them to be publicly whipped, or kept
at hard labour for six months in the House of Correction;
which certainly was a great improvement.</p>

<p>By the Act 17 Geo. II. c. 40. jurisdiction was given to the
Judges of Assize, and the General Quarter Sessions, to try
the Offenders, and punish them by a fine not exceeding
£.200, imprisonment for three months, and other corporal
punishment.</p>

<p>The Laws on this subject were further amended by the 9th of
his present Majesty, cap. 35; by which the <i>Treasurer,
Comptroller, Surveyor, Clerk of the Acts</i>, or any
Commissioner of the Navy, are empowered to act as Justices,
in causing Offenders to be apprehended and prosecuted. These
powers were given with a view to establish a greater degree
of energy in detections; but experience has shewn that the
purpose has not been answered.</p>

<p>The last Act which relates to the protection of the Public
Stores, was made the 12th year of his present Majesty's
reign (cap. 24.) and related solely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">-263-</a></span> to burning ships,
warehouses, and naval, military, or victualing stores, in
any of the dominions of the Crown; which offence is made
felony without Benefit of Clergy.</p></div>

<p>A very superficial view of the above Laws will demonstrate their
insufficiency to the object of <i>Prevention</i>. And even if they were
complete, the task imposed on the public officers, who are on every
occasion to act as Justices, has proved from experience to be a
measure ill calculated to attain the object in view, namely, the
detection of offenders; otherwise the evil would not have
increased.&mdash;Other <i>remedies</i> must therefore be applied. It is not,
however, by any single act of the Legislature, that the enormous
frauds and depredations in the Navy and Victualing Departments of his
Majesty's service, which the Commissioners and chief Officers, under
whose management they are placed, are so anxious to suppress,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> can
be remedied: This important object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">-264-</a></span> must be obtained by a combination
of various salutary measures, calculated to afford collateral aid to
specific Legislative Regulations, and to secure their effectual
execution, by means which are now to be explained under their
respective heads.&mdash;</p>


<h3>I. <span class="smcap">A General Police System.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the Establishment of a Central Board of Police, on the Plan
strongly recommended by the Select Committee of the House of Commons
on Finance, in their 28th Report, ordered to be printed in June
1798:&mdash;It is there proposed to bring under regulations by licences,
all those classes of dealers in <i>old and second-hand ships'
stores&mdash;old iron and other metals</i>, and several other dangerous and
suspicious trades, the uncontrolled exercise of which, by persons of
loose conduct, is known to contribute to the concealment and
multiplication of crimes.&mdash;Infinite embarrassments would, through this
collateral me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">-265-</a></span>dium, be placed in the way of those particular Dealers,
who reside in the vicinity of the Dock-yards, and who, by a variety of
criminal devices, while they are instrumental in doing much mischief,
have been able, in many instances, to elude Justice, and to carry on
their nefarious practices with impunity.</p>

<p>A Board of Police so organized, by means of Licences and subordinate
Officers, as to keep the conduct of these classes of delinquents in
view who, by giving facilities to the embezzlers and stealers of naval
and other stores, are the chief sources from whence the evil springs;
and with power to refuse Licences to those who are known to have been
guilty of criminal conduct; would operate very powerfully in limiting
these classes of dealers to the honest part of their trade, by which
infinite mischief would be prevented.</p>


<h3>II. <span class="smcap">A Local Police for the Dock-yards.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Salutary</span> as the Central Board, recommended by the Select Committee on
Finance, must certainly be in controlling and checking the Naval
plunder, in common with the general delinquency of the whole country,
it would seem indispensably necessary, under circumstances where the
moving property is so extensive, and where there exists so many
resources and temptations leading to the commission of crimes, to fix
on some one person the responsi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">-266-</a></span>bility of carrying the Laws into
effect, and of controlling and overawing the various classes of
Delinquents, whose attention is directed to the Dock-yards, as a means
of obtaining plunder: That for this purpose, one able and intelligent
Magistrate should preside in a Police Office, to be established by
Law, at or near the Dock-yards, at <i>Chatham</i>, <i>Portsmouth</i>, and
<i>Plymouth</i>, with an establishment consisting of <i>one Clerk, two House
and four Boat Constables</i>, with <i>two Police Boats</i> attached to each
Office. One Magistrate would be sufficient at each Office, as
assistance from the neighbouring Justices could always be procured in
case of sickness, or absence, or where any judicial proceeding would
require two Magistrates.</p>

<p>No establishment would be necessary for the Dock-yards, and Public
Arsenal, at Deptford and Woolwich, as the great civil force, and the
number of boats attached to the Marine Police Office at Wapping, when
strengthened, extended, and improved in the manner which is proposed,
would be competent to carry into effect the Laws now in being, and
such as may hereafter be enacted, for the prevention and detection of
offences in every part of the River Thames, from London Bridge to the
Hope Point.</p>

<p>The Magistrate proposed to be established at Chatham, could
occasionally administer justice at Sheerness, while the Boat Officers
belonging to the Institution, might be employed advantageously in
traversing the River Medway, and in keeping a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">-267-</a></span> watchful eye on the
various Receivers of stolen goods, who reside in the vicinity of that
River, between the two Dock-yards.</p>

<p>At Portsmouth and Plymouth there would be regular employment for the
respective Magistrates, and the Boat and other Officers on these
establishments.</p>

<p>These three Institutions may be conducted at an expence not exceeding
one thousand pounds a year each, viz:&mdash;</p>

<table style="width: 90%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="salaries">
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class="right">£.</td><td class="right"><i>s.</i></td><td class="right"><i>d.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>To the responsible resident Magistrate</td><td class="right">300</td><td class="right">0</td><td class="right">0</td></tr>

<tr><td class="right">Total</td><td class="rtbl">1000</td><td class="rtbl">0</td><td class="rtbl">0</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Towards defraying this expence, the fees which would be received, and
the penalties inflicted for minor offences, under the Legislative
regulations hereafter to be proposed, would go a certain length in
reducing the expences of the three Police Institutions. But
considering the advantages likely to result from those Establishments,
were the expence to be incurred even <i>fifty times</i> the amount of what
is estimated, it would in all probability be much more than
compensated by the savings to the Public, which will result from the
preservation of the Public property, independent of the advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">-268-</a></span>
which must arise from an improvement in the morals of a numerous class
of delinquents, who have long been in a course of criminal turpitude.</p>

<p>A Police System thus organized under the direction of a Magistrate in
each situation, whose attention would be solely confined <i>to this one
object</i>, could not fail to be productive of the greatest good,
especially when aided by officers, well selected and encouraged to be
<i>vigilant</i> and <i>pure</i> in their conduct, from the advantages they would
derive from a moiety of the pecuniary penalties, when offenders were
convicted, in addition to their salaries, thereby rendering their
situations comfortable and desirable, and fortifying them against
seduction and connivance with Receivers and Thieves, as too often has
been discovered to take place, with respect to parochial Constables
resident near the Dock-yards, by which Public Justice has been
frequently defeated. The terror which such a System would excite, and
the extensive evils a Boat Police are likely to prevent, can only be
conceived by those who have witnessed the effect of the Marine Police
on the River Thames.</p>

<p>But still apposite Legislative regulations will be necessary to give
full effect to this design, and the following heads are suggested as
likely to be productive of infinite public advantage, when passed into
a Law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">-269-</a></span></p>


<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Legislative Regulations proposed in aid<br />

<div class="blockquot"><p>1st. That persons having possession of <i>New Naval Stores</i>;
or <i>Naval Stores not more than one-third worn</i>, with the
King's mark thereon, shall be deemed guilty of receiving

Court to reduce it to seven years, or to impose a fine, or
punish the offender corporally at its discretion.</p>

<p>4th. In all cases where the Crown or its Agents shall
decline to prosecute persons, in whose possession the King's

offences are to be more minutely explained) and if the party
shall not give an account to the satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">-270-</a></span> of the
Justice, how the said goods came into his possession, to be
convicted of a misdemeanor, and subject to a fine of 40<i>s.</i>

conveying stores, or in returning after such stores are
delivered, for the purpose of searching the same; and in all
cases, where stores are found which appear to have been
abstracted from the cargo, or otherwise unlawfully obtained,
to seize and convey the same, with the offender or
offenders, (without prejudice to the service) before a
Justice; and in case the Solicitor for the Crown, (on due
notice given, shall decline to prosecute for the major
offence) the parties in whose custody the stores were found,

assist Marine Police Constables in the execution of their
duty; of obstructing the said Officers; of damaging Police
Boats, to be punished as misdemeanors, under the authority
of the said Bumboat Act, and the proposed Thames Police Act;
namely, by fine or imprisonment.</p>

<p>7th. <i>Boats, craft, carts, carriages</i>, or <i>horses</i>, &amp;c. from
which stolen or embezzled King's stores shall be seized, to

unmarked stores, otherwise the same to be forfeited, and
sent to his Majesty's Repositories.</p>

<p>9th. Power to be granted to the Commissioners of the Navy,

this case to extend to all Counties in England.</p>

<p>10th. The Laws relating to falsifying, erasing, or
fabricating <i>documents, vouchers, books, accounts</i>, or
<i>writings</i>, of any kind, with an intent to defraud his
Majesty, to be revised and amended, so as to apply more
pointedly to offences of this nature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">-272-</a></span></p>

<p>11th. Persons in his Majesty's service in any of the
Dock-yards or Public Arsenals, having King's stores in their
possession, to the amount of 5<i>l.</i> value, and not being
authorised to keep such stores, to be conclusive evidence of
embezzlement, and to be punished by transportation.</p>

<p>12th. As an encouragement to excite vigilance in Officers of
Justice, it is humbly proposed, that the Commissioners of
his Majesty's <i>Navy, Victualing, and other Departments</i>,
should be authorised, and required by Law, to pay the
following rewards for the conviction of offenders, on the
certificate of Judges and Magistrates, before whom such
convictions took place&mdash;</p>

<p>40<i>l.</i> on Conviction for any Capital Offence.</p>

<p>20<i>l.</i> on Conviction for Felony, punished&mdash;Transportation,
Fine or Imprisonment, or Whipping, before a Superior Court.</p>

<p>10<i>l.</i> for Misdemeanors, by Indictment before the Quarter or
General Sessions of the Peace.</p>

<p>2<i>l.</i> for Convictions before Justices for Minor Offences.</p></div>

<p>From such <i>Legislative Regulations</i> infinite would be the advantages
which might reasonably be expected, when by the establishment of a
Naval Police System, their due and proper execution would be rendered
certain; and also, in all cases, where the evidence against offenders,
although perfectly conclusive as to the fact, may be deficient in some
points of legal nicety, by putting the <i>onus probandi</i> on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">-273-</a></span>
offender, and treating it as a minor offence: the ends of Public
Justice will, in a great measure, be answered by inflicting some
punishment on the offender, and however inferior it may be to what he
deserves, it will still have an excellent effect, since it is not so
much by severe punishments, as by the certainty of <i>some punishment</i>
being inflicted, and the obloquy of a conviction when offences are
committed, that Delinquents of this class are deterred from the
commission of crimes.</p>

<p>Having thus traced the outlines of such remedies, for the protection
of his Majesty's <i>Naval</i>, <i>Victualing</i>, Ordnance and other stores, as
certainly require Legislative Regulations; it remains now to consider,
what other measures may appear necessary, within the limits of the
authority with which the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty are
invested, for the purpose of rendering the Preventive System complete.</p>

<p>Those which have occurred to the Author of this Work will be classed
under the following Heads:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>IV. <i>Regulations respecting the Sale of Old Stores.</i></p>

<p>V. <i>The Abolition of the Perquisite of Chips.</i></p>

description; to be recompensed by a liberal increase of
Salaries.</i></p>

<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">Old Stores.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mode at present practised in disposing of unserviceable Naval and
Victualing Stores by Auction, in the Public Arsenals and Repositories,
is productive of infinite evils, independent of the cover which is
thereby afforded to many purchasers, of loose conduct, in protecting
them, by means of the certificates they obtain against the penalties
of the Law, as Receivers of stolen and embezzled goods of the same
species and quality; thereby not only defeating the ends of Public
Justice, but operating as an encouragement to these criminal dealers
to extend the iniquitous part of their trade, by holding out
facilities and incitements to those who have access to commit
depredations on the Public Property, which possibly would never have
otherwise taken place.</p>

<p>The Public Sales at the Dock-yards and other Repositories, draw
together men of loose and depraved morals; who, in order to obtain
bargains, do not hesitate (wherever it can be done) to seduce, by
means of pecuniary gratuities, the inferior officers and labourers
into the evil practice of mixing superior stores with unserviceable
articles, ordered to be made up in lots, so as to elude discovery. New
and valuable cordage has been detected coiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">-275-</a></span> within old cables,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
while frauds also are practised as to the weight, and in the delivery
of greater quantities than are actually sold.&mdash;Such practices have
taken place in spite of the vigilance and attention of the superior
officers, by which a two-fold mischief arises,&mdash;in the immediate loss
which is sustained by the frauds thus practised, and in the cover
which is thus afforded for the protection of additional stores
purchased clandestinely; perhaps from the persons who have been thus
corrupted.&mdash;An evil so prominent, in the view of a very able and
penetrating Judge now upon the bench, as to induce him to declare
publicly in Court, immediately after a trial, where a notorious
offender (as many notorious offenders do) escaped Justice, under the
cover of his certificates: "That <i>Government had better burn their old
Stores than suffer them to be the means of generating so many
offences</i>"&mdash;or to the same effect.</p>

<p>It is however humbly presumed that a remedy may be applied without the
destruction of such valuable materials; and the following suggestions
are offered with a view to this object.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">-276-</a></span></p>


<h4><i>Plan for an improved mode of disposing of unserviceable Naval and
Victualing Stores.</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1st. That instead of selling those stores upon the spot
where the criminal connections are formed, the Naval
articles shall be made up in assorted lots suitable to the
<i>London, Bristol, Liverpool, Whitehaven, Glasgow, Newcastle,
and Hull</i> Markets. That a responsible Agent should be
appointed to conduct the sales at each of these
<i>Ports</i>.&mdash;That they shall be men of the first respectability
in the commercial line, who can give ample security for
their fidelity in the execution of the trust reposed in
them.&mdash;That they shall receive the stores at the yards or
repositories where they are made up, and convey them to
their respective Warehouses at their own expence: on having
an allowance of <i>6 per Cent. for Freight-charges,
Warehouse-rent, Insurance</i> against <i>Sea-risk and Fire</i>, and
all other expences; <i>and 4 per Cent. for commission on the
amount of the Sales</i>.</p></div>

<p>That the said stores shall not on any pretence be sold to dealers, but
only to the <i>actual consumers</i>, or Rope Spinners to convert into small
cordage; <i>nor shall any certificate be granted to purchasers on any
pretence whatsoever</i>.</p>

<p>That accounts of sales shall be furnished monthly, and such sales
shall be accompanied by <i>a full remit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">-277-</a></span>tance for the amount</i>, it being
always understood that no credit is to be allowed.</p>

<p>That at the end of each year, an inventory shall be transmitted on a
specific day to be fixed, of the whole stores on hand, and a general
account current shall be then furnished; in which shall be exhibited,
agreeable to a form to be prescribed, a complete view of the whole
transactions which have occurred during the preceding year, with a
full remittance for the balance due on the said account.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>2d. That the <i>Metalic Stores</i> which are deemed unserviceable
shall be deposited in a commodious Magazine in London, under
the charge of a responsible Agent, competent to such a
trust.&mdash;That it shall be his duty to employ proper
Artificers to convert all that are capable of being
converted into serviceable Stores, and when so renovated, to
be returned to Deptford Yard.&mdash;And such Metalic Stores as
are incapable of being converted into useful purposes at a
moderate expence, so as clearly to demonstrate a saving to
Government, shall be disposed of to founders and others, at
the best price that can be obtained.</p></div>

<p>The Agent for Metalic Stores to be allowed 10 per Cent. on the value
as ascertained, by the original Invoice, founded on a survey and
valuation upon oath, and this to be in full of <i>Freight, Carriage,
Warehouse-rent, Insurance from fire, and all other expences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">-278-</a></span>
including Commission for his trouble</i>, on all Stores that are again
converted to useful purposes; and 7&frac12; per cent. on the value of such
as are sold, in consequence of their being incapable of being rendered
useful; so as to make it the interest of the Agent to render as large
a portion useful as possible.</p>

<p>It is presumed that by an arrangement of this kind, an immense sum
will be saved to the Public annually; who would retain the
Contractor's profit in all cases where Old Stores are received back at
the price of old Metal, and again returned at the full contract price,
after a small expence is incurred in converting them into serviceable
Stores.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>3d. That in consequence of the superior resource for the
consumption of <i>Provisions, Casks</i>, &amp;c. in London, the whole
of the unserviceable Victualing Stores (except such as from
their small value and bulky nature will not defray the
expences of conveyance) shall be collected in a large
repository in London, under the charge of an able and
intelligent Agent, who shall give proper security for his
faithful management; and conduct the sales upon the
principles already explained <i>for ready money only</i>,
rendering an account <i>and making his payments monthly</i>, and
a final Account and Inventory at the end of the year; to be
at the whole expence of removing the goods from the
different Repositories to the Magazine in London; to be
allowed 4 per Cent. Commission on the sales, and 6 per Cent.
in lieu of all charges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">-279-</a></span></p>

<p>4th. That the attention of the respective Boards may not be
diverted from other objects by attending to the details,
which will arise in the management of those establishments,
a superintending Agent shall be appointed, who shall receive
the directions of the different Boards, and correspond with
the local Agents.&mdash;He shall moreover be the <i>Receiver
General of the monthly remittances</i>, and shall immediately
pay the same as directed by the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty.&mdash;It will be his duty to arrange the shipping of
Old Stores from the different Yards, in conformity to the
wants or demands of the respective Agents, so as to keep up
their several assortments, by conveying to each not only
such articles, (as far as it can be done) as are most in
demand, but also such as comparatively fetch the best
price.&mdash;He shall receive the monthly and yearly accounts,
and lay an abstract of the same before the Lords of the
Admiralty, and the Navy and Victualing Board respectively,
as they apply to their different departments, and shall be
the general medium of communication from the respective
Boards to the local Agents.&mdash;The superintending Agent shall
transmit a regular invoice to the local Agents of all goods
shipped:&mdash;Shall keep regular books and accounts of all
transactions under his charge, and shall receive for his
trouble <i>1 per cent.</i> on the Remittances or Payments which
he may make, under the directions of the Lords of the
Admiralty.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">-280-</a></span></p>

<p>By this arrangement it will be the interest of all the parties
concerned, to render the sale as productive as possible; and as the
stores in question will constantly be exposed to sale, where the
demand for such articles is most extensive, the probability is, that
higher prices will be obtained than at present; and that upon the
whole, after paying all expences, a larger aggregate sum will be
received annually by Government, since, as the sales are only to be
made to the actual Containers, the Dealer's profit will make a part of
the Sale Price, and will be thereby secured to the Public. As men of
the first character and respectability may be expected to solicit for
such Commissions, no doubt can be entertained, either of the purity of
their conduct, or their exertions to sell to the best advantage. Their
credit and interest, and also the emulation between one Agent and
another, as to who shall make the best sales, will prove a powerful
stimulus and a strong ground of security.&mdash;Above all, the plan is easy
and practicable:&mdash;It imposes no trouble upon the superior or inferior
officers in the different Naval Departments, and no doubt can be
entertained, that while it shuts up all the avenues to fraud and
peculation, which at present operate so powerfully in facilitating the
stealing and embezzling of Naval and Victualing Stores, in the result
it will prove highly beneficial to Government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">-281-</a></span></p>


<h3>V. <span class="smcap">The Perquisite of Chips.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> extensive evils arising from the permission granted to Artificers
in the Dock-yards, to convert chips to their own use, and to remove
them in bundles from the Dock-yards, having already been noticed, it
may only be necessary to add, that on the abolition of this
perquisite, which the Author has reason to believe is now in
contemplation, a liberal increase of wages should be made to the
Artificers in lieu thereof; and that hereafter Chips should not be
sold in the Yards by Public Auction, but removed to a place of deposit
at some small distance, and disposed of, not to the highest bidder,
but at such price as should be offered above the estimated value, and
by no means by contract.</p>

<p>By adopting this mode, the saving of <i>useful Timber, Time, and
Property</i>, which, through the medium of the existing practice, is
<i>purloined, lost and stolen</i>, would probably exceed any estimate that
has been formed from a view of the present abuses.</p>

<p>This measure, while it forms an important Link in the preventive
Chain, would appear to be easy and practicable.</p>

<p>If necessary the superintending Agent for unserviceable stores, whose
functions have already been explained, could take upon him the sole
management of the disposal of the chips at the different Yards, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">-282-</a></span>
which a handsome sum might be obtained annually in aid of the
resources of the State, perhaps more than would be sufficient to pay
the additional wages of the Artificers, while no existing arrangement
in the Yards would be disturbed, nor any trouble given to the
Officers, who at present fill the respective Departments in those
Arsenals.</p>


<h3>VI. <span class="smcap">The Abolition of Fees and Perquisites,<br />
and an Increase of Salaries.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> total Abolition of Fees guarded by the severest penalties, is an
important object in the preventive System: Until this is effected, it
will be in vain to expect purity of conduct. Under this pretext, men
of loose principles, in transactions with Government, seldom fail to
seduce from the strict line of their duty, <i>avaricious, extravagant,
or indigent Officers</i>, whose business it is to check and control the
receipt and delivery of property, and to <i>arrange, settle, and adjust
Accounts</i>, or <i>to form Public Documents</i>. The delusion and seduction
of these Officers is not seldom effected by the supposed liberality of
those whose business must pass through their hands; and they are not
at all times perfectly aware of the injury that is done to the Public.</p>

<p>It has already been observed, and it is a circumstance much to be
lamented, that in too many instances, where individuals have pecuniary
transactions with any of the Departments of Government, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">-283-</a></span> dereliction
of principle is apparent which does not extend to the general
intercourse of society, and hence arises the necessity of <i>stronger
guards</i>, where the Public interest is concerned; and nothing appears
to be better calculated to counteract this baneful propensity in the
human mind than <i>the total abolition of fees and perquisites</i>.</p>

<p>It is said to be no uncommon thing to pay 300<i>l.</i> for a Clerk's
situation in the Dock-yards, where the salary does not exceed 30<i>l.</i>
or 40<i>l.</i> a year; and it is known that some who hold such situations
live very expensively. It may be fairly asked, in what manner a person
so situated is to reimburse himself? the conclusion is obvious, and
the result has been already explained, which may perhaps be still
farther elucidated by stating the following fact:&mdash;</p>

<p>An Officer of Justice having discovered some instances of pillage and
peculation going forward in the course of the removal of old copper
and other articles, from a dismantled ship of war, complained to the
Store-keeper in the Dock-yard, whose province it was to have received
those articles into his charge, which were conveyed elsewhere.&mdash;He
replied thus: "D&mdash;n it, mind your own business.&mdash;Such things have
always been done, and will continue in spite of you and me; it will,
at any rate, last our time."</p>

<p>While the resources of Government are fully commensurate to the
liberal remuneration of its servants, so as to place them above all
temptations to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">-284-</a></span> abuse the trust reposed in them: and while such
remuneration is in itself no less politic than just, the object and
view of the Author of these pages differs widely from this faithless
servant of the Crown. The suggestions now offered, lead to measures,
which he now trusts to the honour and credit of those respectable
characters, at the head of the different departments, are in the best
train of being adopted, by the total abolition of Fees and
Perquisites, and a liberal Increase of Salary, in lieu of the
reduction of income, which such an arrangement will occasion: Such
salaries as will secure to the Nation those inestimable advantages,
which always result from <i>rectitude of conduct</i>, <i>zeal</i>, <i>accuracy</i>,
and <i>fidelity</i>, in the discharge of Public trusts committed to
subordinate Officers. It is by this and other wise and practicable
arrangements, that a confidence is to be established, "that the
resources of the State <i>will not only last our time</i>," but extend to
many generations; while the improvement of Public morals will
contribute, in an eminent degree, to the happiness and prosperity of
the country.</p>


<h3>VII. <span class="smcap">An improved Mode of Keeping Accounts.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> an impression, that very few improvements have been introduced,
since the establishment of the original System, for keeping the Navy
and Victualing Accounts, brought forward by <span class="smcap">King James II.</span> when Duke
of York; while the frauds which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">-285-</a></span> been committed by various
devices, prove some imperfections in the mode of accomptantship as now
practised, since no means appear to exist, whereby deficiencies can be
checked and discovered; it may be worthy of inquiry, whether many of
the modern improvements, which the vast extent of our Commerce has
introduced, might not be rendered useful in establishing new Checks,
by means of a System of Book-keeping, which would have the same effect
in detecting frauds, and discovering inaccuracies, as prevails in
arranging and closing the accounts of well-regulated Commercial
Establishments; adopting at the same time in the general detail,
particularly in the transit of stores, some of these excellent
regulations, which have been found so salutary and useful in the
system of the Excise. Of the practicability of improvements of this
nature there can be little doubt, since it merely depends on the
exercise of that <i>knowledge, attention</i>, and <i>assiduity</i>, which, when
properly exerted, has generally accomplished objects, which have often
appeared impracticable to minds uninformed, or not enlarged by an
extensive intercourse with the world, or a knowledge of the general
affairs of life:&mdash;But as this observation can in no respect apply to
the respectable and intelligent Individuals, who superintend the Great
Public Concerns, which have been subject to the various abuses, which
they feel so anxious to remedy, sanguine hopes are entertained, that
an improvement in the mode of keeping the Official Accounts may be
speedily carried into effect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">-286-</a></span></p>


<h3>VIII. <span class="smcap">An annual Inventory of Stores.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Supposing</span> an accurate System of Book-keeping to be adopted, and to be
followed as a part of the proposed System of Accuracy, indispensably
necessary, <i>by an annual account of Stores</i>; the advantages resulting
from it are not to be estimated by the most sanguine mind. Independent
of the benefits which would arise from the general accuracy, which
would thus incircle the whole &#339;conomy of the design, discoveries
would be made wherever frauds or embezzlements took place, while the
labour and expence, which such a task might impose, would be
compensated one hundred fold, in the National advantages which it
would produce.</p>

<hr class="dbl1" />
<hr class="dbl2" />

<p>Thus has the Author briefly gone over the whole ground, which he had
assigned to himself, as comprehending every object on the subject of
the depredations on his Majesty's Stores, which appeared likely to
render his suggestions useful to his country, whether they relate to
improved Legislative Regulations requiring the aid of Parliament, or
to Measures competent for the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to
carry into effect. In the prosecution of this task he has been
stimulated in a particular degree, by the laudable and patriotic
disposition, which has been manifested to promote improvements in
Naval Police,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">-287-</a></span> and the honourable proofs he has received of a desire
to render his suggestions useful.</p>

<p>If the period should indeed arrive (and it is to be hoped it may soon
arrive) when these suggestions, or even a part of them, shall be acted
upon, in a manner calculated to promote the National Interest, the
Author of these pages will then feel himself gratified, and rewarded
by the pleasing reflection, that his well-meant labours, in placing an
important branch of the political &#339;conomy of the country in this
particular point of view, have not been in vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">-289-</a></span></p>


<p><span class="cap">H</span>AVING in the preceding Chapters completed the proposed explanation of
the various depredations and frauds upon the Public: It remains now,
in the order of the plan, to examine and follow up the progress of
this property, from the hands of <i>Thieves</i>, <i>Robbers</i>, <i>Cheats</i>, and
<i>Swindlers</i>, to that of <i>Receivers</i>, or first Purchasers of Goods
stolen or fraudulently obtained.</p>

<p>In contemplating the characters of all these different classes of
delinquents, there can be little hesitation in pronouncing the
<i>Receivers</i> to be the most <i>mischievous of the whole</i>; inasmuch as
without the aid they afford, in purchasing and concealing every
species of property stolen or fraudulently obtained, Thieves, Robbers,
and Swindlers, as has already been frequently observed, must quit the
trade, as unproductive and hazardous in the extreme.</p>

<p>Nothing therefore can be more just than the old observation, "<i>that if
there were no Receivers there would be no Thieves</i>."&mdash;Deprive a thief
of a sale and ready market for his goods, and he is undone.</p>

<p>Let the strong arm of the law, and the vigour and energy of the Police
be directed in a particular manner against <i>Receivers</i>; and the chief
part of those robberies and burglaries, which are so much dreaded, on
account of the acts of violence which attend them, <i>would absolutely
cease to exist</i>:&mdash;and the resource for plunder being thus narrowed in
so great a degree, robberies on the highway would <i>alone</i> seldom
answer the purpose of the adventurer; where the risk would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">-290-</a></span> be so
exceedingly multiplied, while the advantages were in the same
proportion diminished;&mdash;the result therefore would be, that in <i>the
suppression of the Receivers</i>, the encouragement to become Thieves and
Robbers would be taken away: and the present Depredators upon the
Public must either return to honest labour as useful members of the
State, or submit to be starved.</p>

<p>Obvious and desirable however as a measure of this sort would be, it
has never hitherto been put in practice. This has proceeded from a
variety of causes; one of the principal of which is the disjointed
state of the Police of the Metropolis, occasioned by a number of
jurisdictions clashing with each other, and preventing the full
operation of a proper system of vigilance and energy; which, with the
aid of apposite and improved laws and a superintending agency, could
not fail, either to root out all the Receivers of stolen Goods of any
consequence, or compel them to abandon their mischievous trade.</p>

<p>These observations apply to that class of Receivers alone, who are in
immediate connection with the thieves, burglars, and highway
robbers;&mdash;and who aid and assist them in the purchase and concealment
of whatever is stolen.&mdash;From the best information that can be
obtained, their number does not exceed <i>fifty</i> or <i>sixty in all</i>; of
whom not more than ten, (whose names and places of abode are well
known) can be said to be persons of property who can raise money to
purchase articles of considerable value.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">-291-</a></span></p>

<p>Aided by a well-regulated and energetic system of Police that might
pervade the whole Metropolis, how easy would it be, to compel these
large dealers to abandon the trade? The measure of watching their
houses day and night, would cost no great sum, and would embarrass the
thieves and burglars, more than any other system that could be
pursued.</p>

<p>It rarely happens that thieves go upon the highway, or commit
burglaries, until the money they have previously acquired is
exhausted. Having laid their plans for new depredations, negociation
is frequently entered upon with the most favourite Receiver, who (to
use their own language) is likely to be <i>staunch</i>, and to keep their
secrets.&mdash;The plan is explained.&mdash;Some liquor is drunk to the good
luck of the enterprize, and the hour fixed when they are to return
with the booty: if plate is expected, the crucible is ready in a small
furnace, built for the purpose, instantly to melt it, and arrangements
are made for the immediate concealment of the other articles.&mdash;Of the
nature of these previous arrangements, something has already been said
in <a href="#CHAP_IV">Chap. IV.</a> on Burglary and Highway Robbery.</p>

<p>There are, however, exceptions to this rule, where the Receivers are
not trusted till the booty is acquired; and where it is in the first
instance removed to the houses of the thieves, or to those of some of
their friends; but it seldom remains longer than may be necessary to
obliterate the marks: for money must be procured. Most thieves are
improvident; their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">-292-</a></span> wants are therefore pressing&mdash;they <i>must</i>
sell&mdash;the Receiver knows this and makes his own terms;&mdash;and he of
course enjoys by far the largest share of the profit.</p>

<p>The plunder thus purchased, finds a ready vent through the extensive
connections of the Jew dealers, both in this Country and upon the
Continent: and from the facts already stated in the course of this
Work, it may easily be conceived that the trade is not only extensive,
but that the profit is immense, since it rarely happens (except in the
articles of plate,) that thieves receive to the amount of above
one-third; or one-fourth of the value of what is stolen.</p>

<p>The mass of the Receivers of stolen property in and near the
Metropolis, (exclusive of those more immediately concerned in
River-plunder, as stated in <a href="#CHAP_VIII">Chapter VIII.</a> on that subject,) may be
classed in two divisions:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"1. The Dealers already mentioned, as immediately connected
with professed and notorious thieves, and who are their
principal supporters, especially when apprehended and under
prosecution. Many of these have themselves been originally
thieves upon the town, <i>acquitted, pardoned, or discharged
from the hulks</i>: who prefer the trade of a Receiver as less
hazardous and more profitable, than that of a thief; and to
conceal the fraud frequently set up <i>Chandlers-Shops</i>,
<i>Coal-Sheds</i>, <i>Potatoe-Warehouses</i>, or <i>Old Iron-Shops</i>, and
not seldom become <i>Masters of Public Houses</i>, that they may
appear to have some <i>visible</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">-293-</a></span> means of obtaining a
livelihood. Those who have not been originally thieves
generally keep shops in different branches of trade, some of
whom are very opulent.</p>

<p>"2. The Dealers in <i>Old Iron and other Metal&mdash;Rags&mdash;Old
Wearing Apparel&mdash;Buyers, Refiners, and Workers of Gold and
Silver&mdash;Dealers in Second-hand Furniture, and Building
Materials, and that Class of Sharping Pawnbrokers who have
connections with criminal people</i>.</p>

<p>"The Dealers last mentioned are extremely numerous, and
amount to several thousands in the Metropolis alone, some of
whom are <i>innocent Receivers</i>, not aware that they are
purchasing stolen articles;&mdash;others, <i>careless Receivers</i>,
asking no questions, and purchasing every thing that is
offered:&mdash;but a large proportion of <i>criminal Receivers</i>,
who purchase every thing that is offered <i>in the way of
trade</i>; well knowing, from the price and other
circumstances, that the property was originally stolen."</p></div>

<p>As the Laws now stand, (numerous, and pointed as they appear to be) it
has been found from experience, that neither of these classes can be
easily reached; and hence it is that they have multiplied in so great
a degree, (particularly the small Receivers) within the last twenty
years, and may even be said to have reigned with impunity.</p>

<p>For the purpose of suggesting an effectual legisla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">-294-</a></span>tive Remedy, it
will be necessary to examine shortly the laws now in being, which are
applicable to this peculiar offence.&mdash;</p>

<p>By the Statute of the 3d and 4th of William and Mary, cap. 9, it is
enacted, "<i>that Receivers of stolen Goods, knowing them to be stolen,
shall be deemed Accessaries after the fact</i>."</p>

<p>But this offence being dependent on the fate of the Principal&mdash;a
Receiver, thus circumstanced, could not be tried till after the
conviction of such Principal; so that, however strong and conclusive
the evidence might be, the Receiver was still safe, unless the Thief
could be apprehended&mdash;and even if apprehended and put upon his trial,
if acquitted through any defect of evidence, the Receiver, (although
he had actually confessed the crime, and the goods found in his
possession, could be proved to have been stolen,) must be
acquitted:&mdash;this offence also, even if completely proved, applied only
to capital felonies, and <i>not to petty larceny</i>.</p>

<p>These defects were discovered, and partly remedied by the Statutes 1
Anne, cap. 9; and 5 Anne, cap. 31, which enact, "<i>That Buyers and
Receivers of stolen Goods, knowing them to be stolen, may be
prosecuted for a misdemeanor, and punished by fine and imprisonment;
though the Principal be not previously convicted of felony</i>."</p>

<p>This Act, 5 Anne, c. 31, also greatly improved the Laws applicable to
this species of offence by <i>empowering the Court to substitute a
corporal punish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">-295-</a></span>ment instead of fine and imprisonment; and by
declaring, that if the felony shall be proved against the Thief, then
the Receiver shall be taken as Accessary, and shall receive judgment
of death; but the benefit of Clergy is reserved</i>.</p>

<p>The Laws being still found insufficient, the Statute of the fourth of
George the First, cap. 11, enacted, "<i>That Receivers of stolen Goods,
knowing them to be stolen, should, on conviction, be transported for
fourteen years; and that buying at an under value should be
presumptive evidence of such knowledge</i>:&mdash;and the same statute <i>makes
it felony (according to the nature of the felony committed in stealing
the Goods) for any person directly or indirectly to take a reward for
helping any person to stolen Goods; unless such person bring the felon
to his trial, and give evidence against him</i>."</p>

<p>But these amendments also proving ineffectual, and not being found to
apply immediately to persons receiving stolen <i>lead, iron, copper,
brass, bell-metal or solder</i> taken from buildings, or from ships,
vessels, wharfs, or quays&mdash;It was enacted by the 29th of George the
Second, cap. 30, "<i>That every person who shall buy or Receive such
articles, knowing the same to be stolen, or who shall privately
purchase these respective metals by suffering any door, window, or
shutter, to be left open between sun-setting and sun-rising, or shall
buy or receive any of the said metals in any clandestine manner,
shall, on conviction, be transported for fourteen years, although the
principal felon has not been convicted</i>." Sec. 1.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">-296-</a></span></p>

<p>The same Act <i>empowers one Justice to grant a warrant to search in the
day time for such metals suspected to be stolen, as by the oath of one
witness may appear to be deposited or concealed in any house or
place</i>; and if goods are found, the Act goes so far as <i>to empower two
Justices to adjudge the person having the custody of the same, guilty
of a misdemeanor, if he cannot produce the party from whom he
purchased, or give a satisfactory account how they came into his
possession; and the offender shall, for the first offence forfeit
40s. for the second 4l. and for every subsequent offence 6l.</i>
Sec. 2; 6.</p>

<p>This Act also <i>empowers officers of justice (and watchmen while on
duty) to apprehend all persons suspected of conveying any stolen
metals, as already described, after sun-set or before sun-rise; and if
such persons cannot give a good account of the manner in which they
were obtained, two Magistrates are in like manner authorized to
adjudge them guilty of a misdemeanor, and they forfeit forty
shillings, &amp;c.</i> Sec. 3; 6.</p>

<p><i>The persons also to whom such articles are offered for sale or to be
pawned, where there is reasonable ground to suppose they were stolen,
are empowered to apprehend and secure the parties and the materials,
to be dealt with according to law. And if it shall appear even on the
evidence of the thief, corroborated by other testimony, that there was
cause to suspect the goods were stolen, and that the person to whom
they were offered, did not do his duty in apprehending the person
offering the same, he shall be adjudged guilty of a mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">-297-</a></span>demeanor, and
forfeit twenty shillings for the first offence: forty shillings for
the second, and four pounds for every subsequent offence</i>, Sec. 5, 6.
And so anxious has the Legislature been to suppress the evil of
stealing and receiving metals, that the 8th Section <i>entitles the
actual Thief to a pardon, on the discovery and conviction of two or
more of the Receivers</i>. And the 9th Section <i>screens from prosecution
any person stealing such metals, who shall discover the Receiver to
whom the same were delivered, so as a conviction may follow</i>.&mdash;In
spite, however, of these numerous and apparently effectual checks, it
is to be lamented that the evil has continued to increase.</p>

<p>In the following year it was provided by the Act 30th of George the
Second, cap. 24, <i>that it shall be lawful for any Pawnbroker, or any
other dealer, their servants or agents, to whom any goods shall be
offered to be pawned, exchanged, or sold, which shall be suspected to
be stolen, to seize and detain the persons offering the same, for the
purpose of being examined by a Justice; who is empowered, if he sees
any grounds to apprehend that the goods have been illegally obtained,
to commit the persons, offering the same, to prison for a period not
exceeding six days; and if on further examination, the Justice shall
be satisfied that the goods were stolen, he shall commit the offender
to prison, to be dealt with according to Law; and although it may,
under such circumstances, afterwards appear that the goods in question
were fairly obtained, yet the parties who seized the supposed offender
shall be indemnified</i>.&mdash;Sec. 7, 8.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">-298-</a></span></p>

<p>It would have been useful if the principles of the first of these
excellent acts had extended to every kind of goods and chattels,
<i>horses</i>, <i>cattle</i>, <i>money</i>, and <i>Bank-notes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> as well as to the
metals therein described. Indeed it is to be lamented, that the System
has not been to look at great features of abuse in <i>the gross</i>, so as
to meet every existing evil at once. Thus another partial Statute was
made, 2 George III. <i>c.</i> 28, extending the provisions of the 29th Geo.
II. <i>c.</i> 30. to goods, stores, or materials taken from ships in the
River Thames, by enacting, "<i>that all persons purchasing such goods,
knowing them to be stolen, or receiving the same in a concealed or
clandestine manner between sun-setting and sun-rising, shall be
transported for fourteen years, although the principal felon be not
convicted</i>:" but by the wording of this Act, it is doubtful if it
applies to receiving goods stolen from vessels not afloat in the
river.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>The next Statute applicable to the Receivers of stolen goods, is the
10th of George III. cap. 48, by which it is enacted, "<i>that every
person who shall buy or receive any jewels, gold, silver, plate or
watches, knowing the same to be stolen, where such stealing was
accompanied by a burglary or highway robbery, may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">-299-</a></span> tried as well
before as after the principal felon is convicted; and whether he be
in, or out of custody; and if found guilty, shall be transported for
fourteen years</i>."</p>

<p>Eleven years after passing of the above mentioned Statute, the
Legislature, appearing to be impressed with the great extent of the
depredations committed by persons stealing <i>pewter pots</i>, and desirous
to punish the Receivers, the Statute of the 21st of George the Third,
cap. 69, enacts, "<i>that every person who shall buy or receive any
pewter pot or other vessel, or any pewter in any form or shape
whatsoever, knowing the same to be stolen, or who shall privately buy
or receive stolen pewter, in a clandestine manner, between sun-setting
and sun-rising, shall on conviction, be transported for seven years,
or detained in the House of Correction, at hard labour for a term not
exceeding three years, nor less than one; and may be whipped not more
than three times; although the principal felon has not been
convicted</i>."</p>

<p>In the following Session of Parliament, the Statute 22 George III. c.
28. (said to have been framed by an able and experienced Lawyer and
Magistrate),<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> removed many of the imperfections of former Statutes,
and particularly that which respected Petty Larceny; by enacting,
"<i>that where any goods (except lead, iron, copper, brass, bell-metal,
or solder, the Receivers of which are punishable under the</i> 29th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">-300-</a></span>
George II. c. 30. <i>noticed before, <a href="#Page_295">p. 295</a>.) have been stolen, whether
the offence amount to Grand Larceny, or some greater offence, or to
Petty Larceny only; (except where the offender</i> has been convicted <i>of
Grand Larceny, or some greater offence; when the Receiver must be
prosecuted as an Accessary, and under the 4th</i> George I. c. 11, <i>may
be transported for fourteen years</i>; see <a href="#Page_295">page 295</a>.)&mdash;<i>Every person who
shall buy or receive the same, knowing them to be stolen, shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor, and punished by fine, imprisonment, or
whipping, as the Quarter Sessions, who are empowered to try offenders,
or any other Court before whom they shall be tried, shall think fit,
although the Principal be not convicted; and if the felony amounts to
Grand Larceny, or some greater offence, and the person committing such
felony has not been before convicted, such offender shall be exempted
from being punished as Accessary, if the principal shall be afterwards
convicted</i>."&mdash;Sect. 1.</p>

<p>This Act also empowers <i>one Justice to grant a warrant to search for
stolen goods in the day time, on oath being made that there are just
grounds of suspicion; and the person concealing the said goods, or in
whose custody they are found, shall in like manner be guilty of a
misdemeanor, and punished in the manner before-mentioned</i>.&mdash;Sect. 9.</p>

<p>The same Act extended the powers granted by former Acts relative to
metals, <i>to any other kind of goods: by authorizing peace officers
(and also watchmen while on duty) to apprehend all persons suspected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">-301-</a></span>
of carrying stolen goods after sun-setting and before sun-rising, who
shall, on conviction, be adjudged guilty of a misdemeanor, and
imprisoned, not exceeding six, nor less than three months</i>.&mdash;Sec. 3.</p>

<p>Power is also given by this Act <i>to any person to whom goods,
suspected to be stolen, shall be offered to be sold or pawned, to
apprehend the person offering the same, and to carry him before a
Justice</i>.&mdash;Sec. 4.</p>

<p>And as an encouragement to young Thieves to discover the Receivers,
the same Act provides, <i>That if any person or persons being out of
custody, or in custody, if under the age of 15 years, upon any charge
of felony, within benefit of Clergy, shall have committed any felony,
and shall discover two Receivers, so as that they shall be convicted,
such Discoverer shall have pardon for all felonies by him committed
before such discovery</i>.</p>

<p>These various Acts of Parliament prove how very prominent the evil of
receiving stolen goods has been in the view of the Legislature.&mdash;It is
to be lamented however, that a more general and comprehensive view has
not been taken of the subject, by substituting, instead of the
piece-meal System which has been from time to time adopted, on
suggestions applicable only to particular cases, <i>one general law that
should have embraced every object</i>, and remedied every defect in the
existing Statutes, on this important subject of criminal
jurisprudence.</p>

<p>That these Laws, numerous as they are, and applicable as many of them
appear to be, have not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">-302-</a></span> in any degree effectual, is clearly
manifested by the unquestionable increase of the evil, even to an
extent beyond all calculation.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, where the Receiver is in reality the
greatest offender, and even the source from whence most of the
burglaries and highway robberies have their origin, the Thief being
not seldom his pupil&mdash;<i>Why should not the Receipt of Stolen Goods be
made an original offence?<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>&mdash;Why should not the rewards for
detection, and the punishment on conviction, be the same, in the case
both of the Receiver and the Thief?</i></p>

<p>In contemplating the best means of preventing depredations upon the
public, the simplest and perhaps the most effectual mode would be to
<i>make a stand at this particular point</i>; by bending the attention
<i>wholly</i> to the means of destroying effectually <i>the trade of
Receiving stolen goods</i>; under the fullest conviction that by
accomplishing so valuable a purpose, thieving and swindling in all its
branches would also be, in a great measure, destroyed.</p>

<p>It is believed, that this object (difficult as it may appear) is
attainable, by well digested applicable laws, containing and enforcing
such regulations as would ensure a full and energetic execution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">-303-</a></span></p>

<p>The importance of a measure of this kind is so immense, that if even a
considerable part of one Session of Parliament were employed in
devising and legalizing a proper System, it would be time well and
usefully spent for the benefit of the Country.</p>

<p>The obvious means of remedy seem to lie within a narrow compass. The
first point to be obtained is the <i>Licensing</i> all those dealers (some
of them already particularized in pages <a href="#Page_292">292</a>, <a href="#Page_293">293</a>), whose various
branches of trade are friendly to the encouragement of depredations;
and the putting them under the control of the <i>Central Board of
Police</i>, in the manner stated more fully in the concluding part of
this Work.&mdash;</p>

<p>The next step must be to consolidate and improve the Laws now in
being, relative to <i>Receivers of stolen goods</i>; by an arrangement
which shall render the whole <i>clear</i> and <i>explicit</i>, and applicable to
all the evils which have been felt to exist.</p>

<p>And lastly to make the following additions to these Laws:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"1. To make the receiving stolen goods an <i>original
offence</i>; punishable in the same manner, in all cases, as
the principal felony is punishable by Law.</p>

<p>"2. The offence of receiving <i>money, bank notes, horses,
cattle, poultry</i>, or <i>any matter</i> or thing whatsoever, to be
the same as receiving goods and chattels.</p>

<p>"3. The persons committing any felony or larceny to be
competent to give evidence against the Re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">-304-</a></span>ceiver, and <i>vice
versa</i>; Provided that the testimony and evidence of such
Principal Felon against the Receiver, or the evidence of the
Receiver against the Principal Felon, shall not be of itself
sufficient to convict, without other concurrent evidence:
and that the offenders so giving evidence shall be entitled
to his Majesty's pardon, and also to a reward of from 10<i>l.</i>
to 50<i>l.</i> as hereafter mentioned; unless they shall be found
guilty of wilful and corrupt perjury.&mdash;<i>By this means the
Thief will be set against the Receiver, and the Receiver
against the Thief.</i></p>

<p>"4. That rewards be paid for the detection and apprehension
of Receivers as well as Thieves, in all cases whatsoever,
according to the discretion of the Judge; <i>whether there
shall be a conviction or not</i>; which reward shall not be
less than <i>ten</i> and may extend to <i>fifty pounds</i>.</p>

<p>"5. That the various classes of dealers to be licensed shall
enter into recognizance for their good behaviour: and that
no licences be granted to persons having been convicted of
felony or perjury, nor to any but such as can obtain and
produce a certificate of good character.</p>

<p>"6. That all such licensed dealers, as also <i>Publicans</i>,
<i>Pawnbrokers</i>, &amp;c. shall be subject to a penalty for
concealing any stolen goods which may come into their
possession, after the same are advertised;&mdash;or punished with
transportation, if it can be made appear that such goods
were purchased at an under value, being known to be stolen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">-305-</a></span></p>

<p>"7. That all drivers of Hackney-Coaches, employed to take
fares after twelve o'clock at night, shall be licensed by
the Magistrates of the division; and shall enter into
recognizance for their good behaviour, themselves and one
surety in 50<i>l.</i> at least; and that every such coachman
shall be obliged, whenever he carries any goods or
valuables, to make a report of the same, on the following
morning, to the Magistrate of his district, if no suspicion
arises as to any improper or felonious intention; but in all
cases where a felonious intention shall appear, the coachman
to be authorized and required to call the assistance of the
watchmen and patroles, and to seize and apprehend the
parties, and lodge them and the goods in the nearest
watch-house; there to be kept until brought before a
justice, at the Public-Office of the district, on the
following morning: And although it may ultimately appear
that the coachman was mistaken and the parties innocent, yet
where it shall be manifest to the Justice that he hath acted
<i>bona fide</i>, he shall not be liable to any prosecution:<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
and if it shall appear that the goods so conveyed <i>were</i>
stolen property, then the coachman shall be entitled,
whether a conviction shall follow or not, to a reward of
<i>two guineas</i>; and in all cases where a prosecution shall
follow, he shall be entitled to such further reward as the
Court shall think proper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">-306-</a></span></p>

<p>"8. That all watchmen or patroles who shall appear upon
proper proof to connive at the commission of felonies<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> in
the night time, or while they are on duty; or shall
knowingly conceal any felonious removal of stolen goods, or
goods suspected to be stolen, and conveying to Receivers'
houses, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and liable
to be <i>imprisoned</i>, <i>whipt</i>, or <i>put in the pillory</i>.&mdash;And
in <i>all cases</i> where such watchmen or patroles shall observe
any goods or other articles conveyed in Hackney-coaches, or
in any other manner, while they are upon duty, from one
place to another, they shall report the same to the Justices
at the nearest Public Office, in the morning: But if they
shall have good grounds to suspect a felonious intention,
and that the property is stolen, the goods and all the
parties concerned shall be conveyed to the nearest
watch-house, for the purpose of being brought before a
Magistrate; and such watchmen (acting <i>bona fide</i>) shall not
be liable to any prosecution in case of a mistake; and if a
felony shall have been actually committed, they shall each
be entitled to one guinea, besides their proportion of any
future reward which may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">-307-</a></span> ordered by the Court who shall
try the offenders.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>"</p>
</div>

<p>In the formation of such a System, it is absolutely necessary that
care should be taken to secure a <i>regular</i> and perfect <i>execution</i>, by
means of a proper superintendance and inspection:&mdash;without this, the
best laws will remain a <i>dead letter</i>.&mdash;Such has, in fact, been the
case in a great measure with respect to several of the very excellent
Statutes, now in force, relative to Receivers of stolen Goods; and
such also would be the case with regard to the laws relative to the
<i>Revenue</i>, if a System had not been established to secure their
execution.</p>

<p>If it be allowed that the prevention of crimes is at least of as much
importance to Society, as any consideration connected with partial
revenue:&mdash;if experience has shewn that, after the skill and ingenuity
of the ablest lawyers and the most profound thinkers have been
exhausted in framing laws to meet offences, which are daily committed;
these offences are progressively increasing:&mdash;Is it not clear to
demonstration, that some <i>active principle</i> is wanting, which does not
at present exist, for the purpose of rendering these laws effectual?</p>

<p>This principle of activity is, (it is humbly apprehended,) only to be
established by the introduction of such a System of <i>regulation</i>, as
shall attach to all classes of dealers, who, in their intercourse
with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">-308-</a></span> Society, are in the train of encouraging either directly or
collaterally, transactions of <i>an immoral</i>, <i>a fraudulent</i>, or a
<i>mischievous nature</i>.</p>

<p>The idea is not new in the System of jurisprudence of the
country;&mdash;Publicans have long been under regulations prescribed by
Magistrates; Pawnbrokers also have been of late years regulated to a
certain extent by Statute.&mdash;Let the same principle be extended to the
other dealers alluded to; and let the Legislature, profiting by that
experience which has manifested the cause of the inefficacy of a vast
number of penal Statutes, establish such a system of <i>regulation</i>,
<i>inspection</i>, and <i>superintendance</i>, as will insure to the Public the
full benefits arising from good laws, administered with activity,
purity, and discretion.</p>

<p>Nothing can evince in a greater degree the necessity of <i>inspecting</i>
the execution of all <i>laws of regulation</i> where the well-being of
Society is concerned, than the abuses which occur with regard to the
two classes just mentioned, namely, Public-houses and
Pawnbrokers.&mdash;Many excellent rules are established by the Legislature,
and the Magistrates; but while it is seldom the interest of the
depraved or dishonest part of these two classes to adhere to such
rules, by what means is the execution to be insured, so as to operate
as a complete protection to the Public?&mdash;surely not by the operation
of the law through the medium of common informers; since independent
of the invidious nature of the office, experience has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">-309-</a></span> shewn that the
public good rarely enters into the consideration of persons of this
description; who look merely to their own emolument, frequently
holding up the penalties as a rod by which money is privately
extorted, and the parties laid under contribution, for the purpose of
allowing them to continue in the practice of those abuses, which the
engine used for this nefarious purpose was meant to prevent.</p>

<p>The System of Inspection, thus strongly and repeatedly recommended,
while it remedied these corrupt practices, by preventing the existence
of the evil, could only be disagreeable to <i>Fraudulent Dealers</i>.</p>

<p>The honest and fair Tradesmen, as things are at present circumstanced,
are by no means on an equal footing with men who carry on business by
fraudulent devices.&mdash;Such fair traders who have nothing to dread,
would therefore rejoice at the System of inspection which is proposed,
and would submit to it cheerfully; as having an immediate tendency to
shield them from fraudulent competition, and to protect the Public
against knavery and dishonesty.</p>

<p><span class="cap">I</span>N contemplating the mass of turpitude which is developed in the
preceding Chapters, and which exhibit afflicted Society, groaning
under a pressure of evils and Public wrongs, which, but for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">-311-</a></span>
different views which have been taken of the subject, could not have
been conceived to exist; it may be truly affirmed in the first
instance, that much is to be imputed to deficient and ill-executed
Laws, arising chiefly from the want of a proper System of Police.</p>

<p>Offences of every description have their origin in the vicious and
immoral habits of the people, and in the facilities which the state of
manners and society, particularly in vulgar life, afford in generating
vicious and bad habits.</p>

<p>In tracing the progress of those habits which are peculiar to the
lower orders of the Community in this great Metropolis, from infancy
to the adult state, the cause will be at once discovered, why that
<i>almost universal</i> profligacy prevails, which, by being productive of
so much evil to the unfortunate Individuals as well as the Community
at large, cannot be sufficiently deplored.</p>

<p>Before a child is perhaps able to lisp a sentence, it is carried by
its ill-fated mother to the tap-room of an ale-house;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> in which are
assembled multitudes of low company, many of whom have been perhaps
reared in the same manner. The vilest and most profane and polluted
language, accompanied by oaths and imprecations, is uttered in these
haunts of idleness and dissipation.&mdash;Children follow their parents
during their progress to maturity, and are al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">-312-</a></span>most the constant
witnesses of their besotted courses.&mdash;Reduced, from their unfortunate
habits, to the necessity of occupying a miserable half furnished
lodging from week to week, there is no comfort at home.&mdash;No knowledge
of frugal cookery exists, by which a nourishing and palatable meal can
be provided, and frequently a sufficiency of fuel for that purpose is
not accessible.&mdash;A succedaneum is found in the ale-house at three
times the expence.&mdash;A common fire is provided for the guests,
calculated to convey that warmth which could not be obtained at home;
and food<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and liquor is furnished at an expence which too seldom
leaves any part of the weekly earning for cloathing, and none at all
for education.&mdash;In this manner is a large proportion of what may be
denominated the lowest classes of the people reared in the
Metropolis;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and the result is, that while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">-313-</a></span> many of the adults are
lost to the state by premature death, from sottishness and
irregularity, not a few of their offspring are never raised to
manhood: But this is not all:&mdash;when by means of strong constitutions,
they survive the shocks which nature has sustained in its progress to
maturity under the influence of habits so exceedingly depraved, they
are restrained by no principle of morality or religion,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> (for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">-314-</a></span> they
know nothing of either,) and only wait for opportunities, to plunge
into every excess and every crime.</p>

<p>Profligate and depraved as the lower orders of the People appear to
have been for several centuries in this great Metropolis, it would
seem that the practice of married females resorting to Public-houses,
and mixing generally in tap-rooms with the idle and dissolute, is an
evil habit of a very modern date; for the period is not even too
remote to be recollected, since it was considered as disgraceful for
Females who pretended to any degree of modesty to be seen in a
Public-house.&mdash;It is however now to be lamented that the obloquy of
thus exposing themselves has as little influence, as the rude and
obscene language they uniformly hear uttered.</p>

<p><i>Another cause</i> of the increase of crimes, may be traced to the bad
and immoral education of Apprentices to Mechanical employments.</p>

<p>Although many of their Masters may not be, and certainly are not,
composed of the class whose manners have just been depicted, yet their
habits lead them too generally to Public-houses, where no
inconsiderable proportion of their earnings are expended;&mdash;where low
gaming is introduced, producing ruin and distress to many families
even among the inferior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">-315-</a></span> ranks, who might otherwise have moved through
life with credit and reputation.</p>

<p>The force of such an example on young minds is obvious.&mdash;No sooner
does an apprentice advance towards the last year of his time than he
thinks it incumbent upon him to follow the example of his master, by
learning to <i>smoke</i>.&mdash;This accomplishment acquired (according to his
conception), he is a fit associate for those who frequent
Public-houses. He resorts at first to those of a lower class, to avoid
his master or his relations.&mdash;There he meets with depraved company;
while he conceives he is following only the example of those whose
manners and habits he has been taught, by example, to imitate, he is
insensibly ensnared.&mdash;Having arrived at the age of puberty, and
meeting profligate females in those haunts of idleness, his passions
become inflamed.&mdash;The force of evil example overpowers him.&mdash;He too
becomes depraved.&mdash;Money must be procured to administer to the new
wants which are generated by depravity.&mdash;Aided by the facilities held
out by Old Iron Shops, he pilfers from his master to supply those
wants, or associates himself with Thieves, whose acquaintance he made
in progress of his seduction.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">-316-</a></span></p>
<p>Under the circumstances thus stated, where so many temptations assail
the young and inexperienced, the transition from innocence to guilt is
easy to be conceived.&mdash;And in a Metropolis where there are seldom
fewer than 150,000 apprentices bound to mechanical employments, the
crimes which spring from this source must be very extensive.&mdash;That
there are, however, many good and virtuous young men among the class
of apprentices, who, from a better education, or being under the
control of reputable masters, and attentive parents, escape the snare,
or resist these temptations, is <i>certain</i>; and fortunate too for the
best interests of Society. It is to be lamented, however, that the
major part, and particularly parish apprentices, have not always these
advantages; and hence it is that so many become disorderly, and
require the interference of legal authority and punishment for the
purpose of compelling obedience and good conduct.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">-317-</a></span></p>
<p><i>Another cause</i> of the increase of crimes, arises from the number of
individuals in various occupations among the lower and middling ranks
of life, (and which must naturally be expected in a large Metropolis)
who, from their own mismanagement and want of industry, or attention
to their business, are suddenly broke down, and in some degree
excluded from the regular intercourse with Society. Unable to find
employment, from want of character, or want of friends, with constant
demands upon them for the means of subsistence to themselves and
families, they resort to Public-houses, under the influence of
despondency, or to kill time which hangs heavy upon them.</p>

<p>In these haunts of depravity they meet persons who perhaps have been
in the like circumstances; but who have resorted to illegal Lottery
Insurances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">-318-</a></span> and other swindling devices for subsistence, under whose
banners they inlist; and thus strengthen the phalanx of low gamblers,
swindlers, and cheats, whose various pursuits have been developed in
this Work.&mdash;From one vice to another the transition is easy when the
mind becomes depraved, and the pursuits which are ultimately followed,
depend in a considerable degree on the persons with whom this class of
men associate.&mdash;If at the low gaming-houses, to which from idle habits
they are led to resort, they meet with highwaymen and footpads, they
are easily persuaded to become associates in their iniquitous
pursuits; or if in the wide range of their acquaintance, by living
chiefly in Public-houses, they become acquainted with venders of base
money, they enter with equal facility into their views, as a means of
supplying their pecuniary wants.</p>

<p>In cases where they have been bred to ingenious mechanical
employments, they embrace, wherever a proper opportunity offers, such
propositions as may be made them, to become forgers of Bank Bills and
Notes, and Coiners of Counterfeit Money.</p>

<p>Such is the lamentable progress of vice in the human mind, that by
degrees it embraces eagerly what could not have been indured at the
commencement of the career.</p>

<p><i>Another cause</i> of the increase of Crimes in the Metropolis and its
environs, may be traced to the situation of idle and profligate menial
servants out of place, and destitute of the means of obtaining
situa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">-319-</a></span>tions from the loss of character.&mdash;These too, seek for resources
in Public-houses, where they soon become the associates of Thieves,
Pickpockets, Burglars, and Highwaymen; and it is believed to be
chiefly from this class, particularly <i>Riding Footmen</i>, and
<i>Postillions</i>, that the corps of Highway Robbers is constantly
recruited.&mdash;While others less skilled in horsemanship become Footpads,
Burglars, and Pickpockets.</p>

<p>With the major part of this class the transition is easy&mdash;depravity
had previously taken hold of their minds&mdash;every other resource has
failed them, and to this they resort, as soon as they can find means,
to enlist in any gang that will receive them, where, to those who
confine themselves chiefly to burglaries, their knowledge of the
interior of the houses of their former masters, and their probable
acquaintance with some of the female servants, will be a considerable
recommendation, and even a ground of seduction.</p>

<p><i>Another Cause</i>, and no inconsiderable one, of the progress and
increase of crimes may be developed, by contemplating the deplorable
state and condition of the lower order of the Jews in the Metropolis,
who are of the Society of the Dutch Synagogue.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">-320-</a></span>&mdash;Totally without
education, and very seldom trained to any trade or occupation by which
they can earn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">-321-</a></span> their livelihood by manual labour:&mdash;their youths
excluded from becoming apprentices, and their females from hiring
themselves generally as servants, on account of the superstitious
adherence to the mere ceremonial of their persuasion, as it respects
meat not killed by Jews, nothing can exceed their melancholy
condition, both with regard to themselves and Society. Thus excluded
from these resources, which other classes of the Community possess,
they seem to have no alternative but to resort to those tricks and
devices, which ingenuity suggests, to enable persons without an honest
means of subsistence to live in idleness.</p>

<p>The habits they thus acquire are the most mischievous and noxious to
the Community that can be conceived.&mdash;Having connexions wherever the
Dock-yards are situated, as well as in several other large trading
towns in the Kingdom, they become in many respects the medium through
which stolen goods are conveyed to and from the Metropolis; and as
their existence depends on this nefarious traffick, they keep alive a
System of Fraud and Depredation which, perhaps, is generated in a
greater degree by their peculiar situation in respect to Society, than
by any actual disposition on their parts to pursue these nefarious
practices.</p>

<p>Even the system of supporting the poor of this Community, by lending
them small sums of money by which they may support themselves by a
species of petty traffick, contributes in no small degree to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">-322-</a></span> the
commission of crimes; since in order to render it productive to an
extent equal to the wants of families who do not acquire any material
aid by manual labour, they are induced to resort to unlawful means by
dealing in stolen goods and in counterfeit money, by which they become
public nuisances in the Countries where they receive an asylum.</p>

<p>As there appears in reality to be no distinction made by the rational
part of the Jewish persuasion, between the Portuguese and the Dutch
Synagogues, it is earnestly to be hoped that the opulent and
respectable of the former Community will lend a helping hand in
devising some means of rescuing this part of the Nation of the Jews
who reside in England, from the reproach, which it is to be feared,
has been too justly cast upon them. Policy dictates the measure, while
humanity ardently pleads for it.&mdash;In so good a work every man of
feeling, be his religious persuasion what it may, will join in
promoting and carrying into effect a measure so beneficial to the
Community at large, by devising some means to render their labour
productive; since it is clear to demonstration that to the idle habits
of this numerous class of people, is to be ascribed a considerable
proportion of the petty crimes, as well as some of the more atrocious
offences by which the Metropolis and the Country is afflicted.</p>

<p><i>Another cause</i> of the increase and multiplication of crimes has
arisen from the depraved morals of the Aquatic labourers and others,
employed on the wharfs and quays, and in ships, vessels, and craft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">-323-</a></span>
upon the River Thames; and from the want, <i>until lately</i>, of an
appropriate Preventive System to check these depredations.</p>

<p>The analogy between actual pillage and smuggling in the conception of
nautical labourers, and the uncontrolled habit of plunder which too
long existed, trained up myriads of delinquents who affixed in their
minds no degree of moral turpitude to the offence; which of course
extended itself both with respect to Commercial and Public Property
beyond all bounds, until a remedy was imperiously called for, and at
length applied by means of an experimental System of Police applicable
to that object.</p>

<p><i>Another cause, and certainly none of the least</i>, which has tended to
facilitate the commission of crimes, has been the want of a proper
control over persons of loose conduct and dishonest habits, who have
opened shops for the purchase and sale of <i>Old iron</i>, and <i>other
metals&mdash;Old stores&mdash;Rags&mdash;Old furniture&mdash;Old building materials, and
second-hand wearing apparel, and other goods</i>;&mdash;and <i>also
cart-keepers</i> for the collection and removal of these articles from
place to place.</p>

<p>The easy and concealed mode of disposing of pilfered articles, through
the medium of these receptacles, has tended more to the corruption of
the morals of youth, and to the multiplication of crimes, than it is
possible to conceive; nor has the mode of Licensing <i>Pawnbrokers</i>,
without a due regard to character and a more effectual control, been
in many respects less mischievous to the Community.&mdash;To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">-324-</a></span> the reputable
part of this class of dealers it is degrading and even cruel that the
reproach and stigma, arising from the nefarious practices of the
fraudulent, should unavoidably in the public mind, attach upon those
that are blameless, and fair in their dealings.&mdash;While the law admits
of no power of discrimination, and no means of excluding improper
characters exist, the evil must continue; and while it remains on the
present footing, it must also be considered as no inconsiderable
medium, by which both petty and more atrocious crimes are produced.</p>

<p><i>But perhaps the greatest source of delinquency and crimes is to be
ascribed to ill-regulated Public Houses</i>, conducted by men of loose
conduct and depraved morals&mdash;Since it is in these receptacles that the
corruption of morals originates.&mdash;It is here that the minds of youth
are contaminated, and the conspiracies for the purpose of committing
frauds and depredations on the Public formed and facilitated.</p>

<p>A disorderly and ill-regulated Public-house, therefore, is one of the
greatest nuisances that can exist in civil Society.&mdash;Innumerable are
the temptations which are to be found in these haunts of idleness to
seduce the innocent, and to increase the resources of the
evil-disposed to do mischief.</p>

<p>Whatever tends to promote vice and dissipation, whether arising from
low gaming, by means of cards, dice, dominós, shuffleboard, and other
sedentary games; or fraudulent insurances in the lottery, calculated
to fascinate and seduce the unwary, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">-325-</a></span> poison the minds of all
ranks in the humble walks of vulgar life, is here to be found; in
spite of every laudable precaution, exercised by Magistrates, under
the present System of Police applicable to this object.&mdash;Even
Prostitutes of the lowest cast are not seldom introduced, where the
gains of the landlord are thereby to be promoted.</p>

<p>It is in these receptacles that Thieves and Robbers of every
description hold their orgies, and concert and mature their plans of
depredation on the peaceful Subject; and here too it not unfrequently
happens, that their booty is deposited and concealed.</p>

<p>It is here also that markets are held for the sale of Base Money,
where every facility is afforded for the purpose of concealment, and
assistance in escaping justice.</p>

<p>In fact, there is scarce any moral evil by which <i>Society is
afflicted&mdash;the mind debauched&mdash;the virtuous parent</i> and <i>master
distressed</i>, and the <i>ruin of families and individuals affected</i>,
which is not generated in Public-houses.</p>

<p>At present, in the Metropolis and its environs, there are at least
five thousand of these receptacles, of which it is computed that about
one thousand change tenants from once to three times a year.&mdash;Hence it
follows that not less than two thousand individuals are in a floating
state, either from one Public-house to another, or perhaps, more
frequently, from the Alehouse to a Gaol.</p>

<p>When a depraved character loses his licence in one division of the
Metropolis, he generally finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">-326-</a></span> means to obtain admission in another
where he is not known. The separation of jurisdictions without a
centre point, and the numerous changes which are constantly taking
place, preclude the possibility of detection; while the facility, with
which the worst characters obtain the certificates required by law,
(which are too often signed, without the least previous inquiry, by
the Clergyman and Parish Officers as a matter of course,) enable them
to effect their purpose; and such houses being generally of the
inferior class in point of trade, every species of disorder is
permitted for the purpose of obtaining custom. This is soon discovered
by those who have criminal objects in view; and to such houses they
generally resort, where it has sometimes been discovered that the
Landlord himself belongs to the gang; <i>and</i> that he has become a
Publican the better to facilitate its designs. That the Ale-houses are
yet by far too numerous, is incontestibly proved by the frequent
changes which take place in so large a proportion in the course of a
year, while the irregularities which prevail render it equally clear
that a more general control is necessary to prevent the mischiefs
which have been detailed.</p>

<p>It is chiefly in houses where the trade is inadequate to the support
of the establishment that the greatest disorders prevail, as in such
cases every lure is held out to invite customers, and to entice them
to expend money.&mdash;And in return for this, where the Landlord is not
himself of the fraternity of Thieves or Receivers, he is induced at
least to afford them his assistance, as a medium of concealment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">-327-</a></span></p>

<p>If a plan could be devised, with equal advantage to the Revenue, by
the introduction of more innocent and less noxious gratifications,
whereby the lower ranks of the people could be gradually led into
better habits, much benefit would arise to the State, both with
respect to health and morals.</p>

<p>The quantity of Beer, Porter, Gin, and Compounds, which is sold in
Public-houses in the Metropolis and its environs, has been estimated,
after bestowing considerable pains in forming a calculation, at nearly
3,300,000<i>l.</i> a year.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>This immense sum, equal to double the Revenue of some of the Kingdoms
and States of Europe, independent of other evil consequences in
producing indigence and promoting crimes, must in a certain degree
debilitate manhood&mdash;in lessening the powers of animal life, and in
shortening its duration long before the period arrives, when an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">-328-</a></span> adult
ceases to contribute by his labours to the resources of the State. In
this point of view, independent of considerations of a moral tendency,
and of all the other train of evils which have been detailed, it would
seem of importance, as a political measure, to check the growing
propensity to consume a greater quantity of Porter, Beer, and ardent
Spirits, than is necessary to health.&mdash;To the State, indeed, it
creates a Revenue; but it is a Revenue too dearly purchased if it
wastes the human species&mdash;if it deprives the nation, prematurely, of
the benefit of their labour, and occasions infinitely greater
pecuniary pressures in the support of an indigent and helpless
offspring, who must be reared again to manhood at the expence of the
Public; not to speak of the grain, labour, fuel, &amp;c. unnecessarily
consumed in creating this poison to the health, the morals, and
comforts of the poor.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>&mdash;However unpopular it may appear in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">-329-</a></span>
view of those who have not fully considered the subject, it may be
clearly demonstrated that a triple duty on Malt Spirits, and a much
higher duty on Strong Beer and Porter would be an act of the greatest
humanity on the part of the Legislature.&mdash;The present Revenue might
thus be secured, while that which is even of more importance to a
State than any other consideration would be preserved&mdash;<i>the health and
morals of the labouring people</i>. It is a mistaken notion, that a very
large quantity of Malt Liquor is necessary to support labourers of any
description.&mdash;After a certain moderate quantity is drank, it enervates
the body, and stupefies the senses.&mdash;A Coal-heaver who drinks from 12
to 16 pots of Porter in the course of a day, would receive more real
nourishment, and perform his labour with more ease and a greater
portion of athletic strength, if only one-third of the quantity were
consumed. He would also enjoy better health, and be fitter for his
labour the following day. On a supposition that the excesses in which
perhaps 200,000 of the labouring people in the Metropolis <i>indulge</i>,
shortens the natural period of their existence only five years each on
an average, the labour of one million of years is lost in the lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">-330-</a></span>
of this class of men, after the expence is incurred in rearing them to
maturity, which, during a period of 36 years of adult labour, at
25<i>l.</i> a year, establishes a deficiency to the Community of
<i>Twenty-five Millions sterling</i>: independent of the numerous other
train of evils, which arise to a nation from idle, dissolute and
immoral habits, by which the rising generation is contaminated, and
great inconvenience imposed on the innocent and peaceful subject, from
the increase of crimes which are generated through this medium.</p>

<p>It is to be lamented, that in pursuing this subject, new sources
giving origin and progress to crimes press upon the mind in the course
of the inquiry. To the catalogue already detailed may be added,
<i>Gaming-Houses</i> of every description, particularly <i>houses of the
lower cast</i>; but as this subject has been very fully handled in a
<a href="#CHAP_VI">preceding Chapter</a>, it will be unnecessary to do more than place it in
the general list of causes, which have contributed exceedingly to the
evils, which have afflicted Society in this Metropolis, and which can
only be remedied by a <i>Responsible Police</i>, attaching particularly
upon this baneful propensity by appropriate regulations.</p>

<p>Next to Gaming, Illicit Trade or Smuggling may be mentioned as a very
productive source of criminality. The vast extent of the Trade and
Revenues of the Country; its insular situation, and the temptations
arising from the magnitude of the duties, contribute exceedingly to
the corruption of morals, not only of these engaged in illicit
pursuits, but it is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">-331-</a></span> be lamented also of the inferior officers
themselves, whose duty it is to prevent this evil.</p>

<p>Severe and pointed as the laws unquestionably are with an immediate
view to the prevention of this evil, experience proves how ineffectual
they have been, since every idle and profligate character becomes a
smuggler. But it is not merely the offence of smuggling as it relates
to the revenue, which is to be deplored as a grievance to the Public,
since those on the Sea Coasts of the kingdom, concerned in such
pursuits, are generally of ferocious habits, which produce such
excesses and depredations upon the unfortunate, when suffering the
calamity of shipwreck, as would disgrace the rudest savages.</p>

<p>With contaminated minds, depraved hearts, men given up to such warfare
upon helpless humanity, become fit instruments for every species of
criminality.&mdash;<i>Vagabonds by trade</i>, the transition from one offence to
another is easy, and hence through this medium many culprits are added
to the general catalogue of delinquency, which nothing can check or
prevent but a System of Police, attaching responsibility <i>some-where
instead of no-where as at present</i>.</p>

<p>Crimes are also generated in no inconsiderable degree, by the evil
examples exhibited in <i>Prisons</i>, and by the length of time persons
charged with offences are suffered to remain in gaols previous to
their trial, particularly in the counties adjoining the Metropolis,
where they frequently are in confinement five and six months before
the assizes.&mdash;If they were novices in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">-332-</a></span> villainy before, the education
they receive in these seminaries, in the event of their escaping
justice, returns them upon society, completely proselyted and
instructed in the arts of mischief and depredation.</p>

<p>Nor have the unequal scale of punishments, and the ultimate
unconditional pardons, dictated no doubt by the purest motives of
humanity, a less tendency to generate new crimes. Encouraged by the
chances of escaping free, <i>even after conviction</i>, many delinquents
pursue their evil courses, trusting ultimately to this resource, if
other devices shall fail.</p>

<p>To shew mankind that crimes are sometimes wholly pardoned, and that
punishment is not the necessary consequence, is to nourish the
flattering hope of impunity, and is the cause of their considering
every punishment which is actually inflicted, as an act of injustice
and oppression.</p>

<p>Let the Legislator be <i>tender</i>, <i>indulgent</i>, and <i>humane</i>; but let the
Executors of the Laws be inexorable in punishing;&mdash;at least to a

<hr class="dbl2" />

<p><span class="cap">I</span>N addition to the prominent causes, which contribute to the origin
and the increase of crimes, which have been developed in the <a href="#CHAP_XI">preceding
Chapter</a>, there are other sources of a minor nature still to be traced,
from which infinite evils to the Community spring.</p>

<p>Among these the most important is, the state and condition of the
unhappy Females, who support themselves by Prostitution in this great
Metropolis.</p>

<p>In contemplating their case, it is impossible to avoid dropping a tear
of pity.&mdash;Many of them perhaps originally seduced from a state of
innocence, while they were the joy and comfort of their unhappy
parents. Many of them born and educated to expect a better fate, until
deceived by falsehood and villainy, they see their error when it is
too late to recede. In this situation, abandoned by their relations
and friends; deserted by their seducers, and at large upon the world;
loathed and avoided by those who formerly held them in estimation,
what are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">-335-</a></span> they to do? In the present unhappy state of things they seem
to have no alternative, but to become the miserable instruments of
promoting and practising that species of seduction and immorality, of
which they themselves were the victims.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> And what is the
result?&mdash;It is pitiable to relate.&mdash;They are compelled of necessity to
mingle with the abandoned herd, who have long been practised in the
walks of infamy, and they too become speedily polluted and
depraved.&mdash;Oaths, imprecations, and obscene language, by degrees,
become familiar to their ears, and necessity compels them to indure,
and at length to imitate, and practise in their turn, upon the unwary
youth, who too easily falls into the snare.</p>

<p>Thus it is from the multitudes of those unhappy Females, that assemble
now in all parts of the Town, that the morals of the youth are
corrupted. That unnecessary expences are incurred; and undue, and too
often criminal, means are resorted to, for the purpose of gratifying
passions, which but for these temptations, which constantly assail
them in almost every street in the Metropolis, would not have been
thought of. Through this medium <i>Apprentices, Clerks and other persons
in trust</i> are seduced from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">-336-</a></span> paths of honesty&mdash;Masters are
plundered, and Parents are afflicted; while many a youth, who might
have become the pride of his family&mdash;a comfort to the declining years
of his Parents, and an ornament to Society, exchanges a life of Virtue
and Industry, for the pursuits of the Gambler, the Swindler, and the
Vagabond. Nor is the lot of these poor deluded females less
deplorable. Although some few of them may obtain settlements, while
others bask for a while in the temporary sun-shine of ease and
splendour, the major part end a short life in misery and wretchedness.</p>

<p>What has become of the multitudes of unfortunate females, elegant in
their persons, and sumptuous in their attire, who were seen in the
streets of the Metropolis, and at places of public Amusement twenty
years ago? Alas! Could their progress be developed, and their ultimate
situations or exit from the world disclosed, it would lay open a
catalogue of sufferings and affliction, beyond what the most romantic
fancy could depict or exhibit to the feeling mind.</p>

<p>Exposed to the rude insults of the inebriated and the vulgar:&mdash;the
impositions of brutal officers and watchmen, and to the chilling
blasts of the night, during the most inclement weather, in thin
apparel, partly in compliance with the fashion of the day, but more
frequently from the pawnbroker's shop rendering their necessary
garments inaccessible&mdash;diseases, where their unhappy vocation does not
produce them, are generated. No pitying hand appears to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">-337-</a></span> them in
such situations. The feeling parent or relation is far off. An
abandoned monster of the same sex, inured in the practice of infamy
and seduction, instead of the consolation which sickness requires,
threatens to turn the unhappy victim out of doors, when the means of
subsistence are cut off, and the premium for shelter is no longer
forth-coming; or perhaps the unfeeling landlord of a miserable
half-furnished lodging afflicts the poor unhappy female, by
declarations equally hostile to the feelings of humanity, till at
length turned out into the streets, she languishes and ends her
miserable days in an hospital or a workhouse, or perhaps perishes in
some inhospitable hovel alone, without a friend to console her, or a
fellow-mortal to close her eyes in the pangs of dissolution.</p>

<p>If no other argument could be adduced in favour of some arrangements,
calculated to stop the progress of Female Prostitution, Compassion for
the sufferings of the unhappy victims would be sufficient; but other
reasons occur equally powerful, why this evil should be controlled.</p>

<p>To prevent its existence, even to a considerable extent, in so great a
Metropolis as London, is as impossible as to resist the torrent of the
tides. It is an evil therefore which must be endured while human
passions exist: but it is at the same time an evil which may not only
be lessened, but rendered less noxious and dangerous to the peace and
good order of society: it may be stript of its indecency, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">-338-</a></span> also of
a considerable portion of the danger attached to it, to the youth of
both sexes.</p>

<p>The lures for the seduction of youth passing along the streets in the
course of their ordinary business, may be prevented by a Police,
applicable to this object, without either infringing upon the feelings
of humanity or insulting distress; and still more is it practicable to
remove the noxious irregularities, which are occasioned by the
indiscreet conduct, and the shocking behaviour of Women of the Town,
and their still more blameable paramours, in openly insulting Public
Morals; and rendering the situation of modest women at once irksome
and unsafe, either in places of Public Entertainment, or while passing
along the most public streets of the Metropolis, particularly in the
evening.</p>

<p>This unrestrained licence given to males and females, in the Walks of
Prostitution, was not known in former times at places of public
resort, where there was at least an affectation of decency. To the
disgrace, however, of the Police the evil has been suffered to
increase; and the Boxes of the Theatres often exhibit scenes, which
are certainly extremely offensive to modesty, and contrary to that
decorum which ought to be maintained, and that protection to which the
respectable part of the Community are entitled, against indecency and
indecorum, when their families, often, composed of young females,
visit places of public resort.</p>

<p>In this instance, the induring such impropriety of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">-339-</a></span> conduct, so
contrary to good morals, marks strongly the growing depravity of the
age. To familiarize the eyes and ears of the innocent part of the sex
to the scenes which are often exhibited in the Theatres, is tantamount
to carrying them to a school of vice and debauchery&mdash;</p>

<p>For the purpose of understanding more clearly, by what means it is
possible to lessen the evils arising from Female Prostitution in the
Metropolis, it may be necessary to view it in all its ramifications.</p>

<p>In point of extent it certainly exceeds credibility: but although
there are many exceptions,&mdash;the great mass, (whatever their exterior
may be,) are mostly composed of women who have been in a state of
menial servitude, and of whom not a few, from the love of idleness and
dress, with (in this case) <i>the misfortune of good looks</i>, have partly
from inclination, not seldom from previous seduction and loss of
character, resorted to Prostitution as a livelihood.</p>

<p>They are still, however, objects of compassion, although under the
circumstances incident to their situation they cannot be supposed to
experience those poignant feelings of distress, which are peculiar to
women who have moved in a higher sphere and who have been better
educated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">-340-</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>The whole may be estimated as follows:</i></p>

<p>When a general survey is taken of the Metropolis&mdash;The great numbers
among the higher and middle classes of life, who live unmarried&mdash;The
multitudes of young men yearly arriving at the age of puberty&mdash;The
strangers who resort to the Metropolis&mdash;The seamen and nautical
labourers employed in the Trade of the River Thames, who amount at
least to 40,000&mdash;And the profligate state of Society in vulgar life,
the intelligent mind will soon be reconciled to the statement, which
at first view would seem to excite doubts, and require investigation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">-341-</a></span></p>

<p>But whether the numbers of these truly unfortunate women are a few
thousands less or more is of no consequence in the present discussion,
since it is beyond all doubt, that the evil is of a magnitude that is
excessive, and imperiously calls for a remedy.&mdash;Not certainly a remedy
against the possibility of Female Prostitution, for it has already
been stated, that it is a misfortune that must be endured in large
societies.&mdash;All that can be attempted is, to divest it of the faculty
of extending its noxious influence beyond certain bounds, and restrain
those excesses and indecencies which have already been shewn to be so
extremely noxious to society, and unavoidably productive of depravity
and crimes.</p>

<p>The Author is well aware, that he treads on tender ground, when in
suggesting any measure, however salutary it may be in lessening the
Calendars of Delinquency, <i>it</i> shall have the appearance of giving a
Public sanction to Female Prostitution.</p>

<p>Under the influence of strong prejudices long rooted in the human
mind, it may be in vain to plead <i>plus apud me ratio valebit quàm
vulgi Opinio</i>.</p>

<p>If however the political maxim be true&mdash;<i>Qui non vetat peccare, cum
possit, jubet</i>&mdash;it certainly follows, that by suffering an evil to
continue, when we have it in our power, in a great measure, to lessen
or prevent it, we do <i>violence to reason</i> and <i>to humanity</i>.&mdash;That a
prudent and discreet regulation of Prostitutes in this great
Metropolis, would operate powerfully, not only in gradually
diminishing their numbers, but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">-342-</a></span> in securing public morals against
the insults to which they are exposed, both in the open streets and at
places of public entertainment, cannot be denied.</p>

<p>That young men in pursuit of their lawful business in the streets of
this Metropolis, would be secured against that ruin and infamy, which
temptations thus calculated to inflame the passions, have brought upon
many, who might otherwise have passed through life as useful and
respectable members of Society, is equally true:&mdash;While <i>frauds</i>,
<i>peculations</i> and <i>robbery</i>, often perpetrated for the purpose of
supporting those unhappy women, with whom connections have been at
first formed in the public streets (and in which they themselves are
not seldom the chief instruments) would be prevented.</p>

<p>Were such proper regulations once adopted, the ears and eyes of the
wives and daughters of the modest and unoffending citizens, who cannot
afford to travel in carriages, would no longer be insulted by gross
and polluted language, and great indecency of behaviour, while walking
the streets. Indeed it is to be feared, that the force of evil
example, in unavoidably witnessing such scenes, may have debauched
many females, who might otherwise have lived a virtuous and useful
life.</p>

<p>Whatever consequences might be derived from a total removal of
Prostitutes (if such a measure could be conceived practicable) with
respect to the wives and daughters, who compose the decent and
respectable families in the Metropolis, this apprehension is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">-343-</a></span> allayed
by the proposed measure. While virtue is secured against seduction,
the misery of these unhappy females will also be lessened. Their
numbers will be decreased, and a check will be given, not only to
female seduction by the force of evil example, but to the extreme
degree of depravity, which arises from the unbounded latitude which is
at present permitted to take place, from the unavailing application of
the laws, made for the purpose of checking this evil. If it were
either politic or humane to carry them into effect, the state of
society where such members are congregated together render it
impossible.</p>

<p>Although by the arrangement proposed, a kind of sanction would, in
appearance, be given to the existence of Prostitution, no ground of
alarm ought to be excited, if it shall be proved, that it is to lessen
the mass of turpitude which exists; that it is to produce a solid and
substantial good to the Community, which it is not possible to obtain
by any other means.</p>

<p>What therefore can rationally be opposed to such an arrangement? Not
surely Religion, for it will tend to advance it: Not Morality, for the
effect of the measure will increase and promote it; not that it will
sanction and encourage what will prove offensive and noxious in
society, since all that is noxious and offensive is by this
arrangement to be removed.&mdash;Where then lies the objection?&mdash;<i>In vulgar
prejudice only.</i>&mdash;By those of inferior education, whose peculiar
habits and pursuits have generated strong prejudices, this excuse may
be pleaded; but by the intelligent and well-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">-344-</a></span>informed it will be
viewed through a more correct medium.</p>

<p>Ingenuous minds are ever open to conviction; and it is the true
characteristic of virtuous minds, where they cannot overcome or
destroy, to lessen as much as possible the evils of human life.</p>

<p>To the numerous unhappy females in the Metropolis who live by
Prostitution, this observation peculiarly applies.&mdash;The evil is such
as must be endured to a certain extent&mdash;because by no human power can
it be overcome; but it can certainly be very much diminished&mdash;perhaps
only in one way&mdash;namely, <i>by prescribing rules</i>&mdash;"Thus far shall you
go, and no farther"&mdash;the rules of decorum shall be strictly preserved
in the streets and in public places. In such situations Women of the
Town shall no longer become instruments of seduction and debauchery.</p>

<p>It may be asked, will not all this promote the cause of religion and
morality:&mdash;admitted; but could not this be done without giving the
sanction of the Legislature to pursuits of infamy. The answer is
obvious:&mdash;the Legislature has done every thing already short of this,
to effect the object; but instead of promoting good, the evil has
increased; and it is to be lamented <i>that it is daily
increasing</i>.&mdash;Instead of the walks of Prostitutes being confined as
formerly, to one or two leading streets in Westminster, they are now
to be found in every part of the Metropolis&mdash;even within the
jurisdiction of the city of London; where the dangers arising from
seduc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">-345-</a></span>tion are the greatest, they abound the most of all of late
years.</p>

<p>In adopting the proposed measure, the example of Holland may be
quoted, where, under its former Government, the morals of the people
in general were supposed the purest of any in Europe, while the Police
System was considered as among the best. Italy has also long shown an
example, where Prostitutes were actually Licensed, with a view to
secure Chastity against the inroads of violence, and to prevent the
Public eye from being insulted by scenes of lewdness and indecorum.</p>

<p>Female Chastity, which is highly regarded by the natives of India, is
preserved by rearing up a certain class of females, who are under the
conduct of discreet Matrons, in every town and village; and with whom,
under certain circumstances, an indiscriminate intercourse is
permitted&mdash;a measure of political necessity. Their morals, however, in
other respects are strictly guarded, and their minds are not
susceptible of that degree of depravity which prevails in Europe. They
are taught the accomplishments of singing and dancing&mdash;they exhibit at
public entertainments, and are even called upon to assist at religious
ceremonies.</p>

<p>The unrestrained latitude which is permitted to unfortunate females in
this Metropolis, is certainly an inlet to many crimes.</p>

<p>The places of resort in Summer, and particularly the Public Gardens,
which were formerly an innocent relaxation to sober and discreet
families, can now no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">-346-</a></span> longer be attended with comfort or satisfaction,
from the offensive manners of the company who frequent such places.</p>

<p>It is not that the Gardens are in themselves a nuisance, or that to
the inferior exhibitions any blame is to be imputed; for both might be
rendered the medium of that rational recreation so necessary both for
the health and comfort of the middling or lower ranks of the people,
to whom <i>policy</i> and <i>reason</i> must admit occasional amusements are
necessary.&mdash;If so, what can be more innocent, or better calculated for
health and occasional recreation than the assemblage of decent people
in a Tea Garden?&mdash;</p>

<p>Many of them, however, have been shut up, and this recreation denied
to the people, because Prostitutes resorted to those places; insulted
public morals,&mdash;promoted lewdness and debauchery, and banished modest
and decent families.</p>

<p>This, if the true cause was developed, is not to be imputed to the
place, which in itself was favourable to the innocent amusement of the
people, but to a deficiency in the Police System.&mdash;It was not the
Gardens nor their Keepers that offended.&mdash;The evil arose from the want
of proper regulations, to restrain these excesses and to keep them
within bounds.</p>

<p>Such places of resort under appropriate Police regulations, might be
rendered a considerable source of revenue to the State, while they
added greatly to the comfort and innocent recreation of the
People.&mdash;By shutting up the Gardens the People are driven to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">-347-</a></span>
Ale-houses, where both air and exercise, so necessary to health, are
denied them, and where the same excesses often prevail, tending in a
still greater degree, to the corruption of morals.</p>

<p>Wherever multitudes of people are collected together, as in a great
Metropolis like London, amusements become indispensably
necessary.&mdash;And it is no inconsiderable feature in the science of
Police to encourage, protect, and controul such as tend to innocent
recreation, to preserve the good humour of the Public, and to give the
minds of the People a right bias.</p>

<p>This is only attainable through the medium of a well-regulated
Police.&mdash;It is perfectly practicable to render Public Gardens as
innocent and decorous as a Private Assembly: although under the
present deficient System they are the greatest of all
nuisances.&mdash;Decent and respectable families are compelled to deny
themselves the privilege of visiting them, because no restraint is put
upon indecency, and vice reigns triumphant.</p>

<p>It is because things are either done by halves, or nothing is done at
all to secure the privileges of innocence, that the sober and harmless
part of the community are compelled to forego those recreations which
contributed to their comfort: while the young and thoughtless,
heedless of the consequences and inexperienced as to the effect, rush
into the vortex of dissipation, and unable to discriminate, become
victims to the licentiousness which is suffered to prevail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">-348-</a></span></p>

<p>Since recreation is necessary to Civilized Society, all Public
Exhibitions should be rendered subservient to the improvement of
morals, and to the means of infusing into the mind a love of the
Constitution, and a reverence and respect for the Laws.&mdash;How easy
would it be under the guidance of an appropriate Police, to give a
right bias through the medium of Public amusements to the dispositions
of the People.&mdash;How superior this to the odious practice of besotting
themselves in Ale-houses, hatching seditious and treasonable designs,
or engaged in pursuits of the vilest profligacy, destructive to health
and morals.</p>

<p>Even the common Ballad-singers in the streets might be rendered
instruments useful under the controul of a well-regulated Police, in
giving a better turn to the minds of the lowest classes of the
People.&mdash;They too must be amused, and why not, if they can be amused
innocently.&mdash;If through this medium they can be taught loyalty to the
Sovereign, love to their Country, and obedience to the Laws, would it
not be wise and politic to sanction it?</p>

<p>If in addition to this, moral lessons could occasionally be conveyed,
shewing in language familiar to their habits, the advantages of
<i>Industry and Frugality</i>&mdash;The pleasure of living independent of the
Pawnbroker and the Publican&mdash;The disgrace and ruin attached to
drunkenness and dishonesty, and the glory and happiness of a <i>good
Husband</i>, a <i>good Father</i>, and <i>an honest Man</i>, might it not
reasonably be expected, that in a religious as well as a moral point
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">-349-</a></span> view, advantages would be gained, while the people were both
instructed and amused?</p>

<p>Crimes have been generated in a considerable degree both by immoral
and seditious books and songs.&mdash;It is true the laws are open to
punishment. The road however to justice, with respect to the former,
is circuitous and difficult, while in the latter case their execution
is felt to be <i>harsh</i>, <i>severe</i>, and <i>ultimately ineffectual</i>: hence
licentious and mischievous Publications prevail, and Ballad-singers
are suffered often to insult decency, and to disseminate poison in
every street in the Metropolis.</p>

<p>Like many other evils they remain in spite of the statutes made to
prevent them.&mdash;They were evils suffered centuries ago where the laws
proved equally unavailing: but the state of society and manners
rendered them less dangerous.</p>

<p>In the Machine of Government there are many component parts where
responsibility attaches;&mdash;<i>but with respect to objects of Police, it
would seem at present to rest no where</i>, and hence is explained at
once, the want of energy in the execution of our laws, and why so many
excellent Statutes remain a dead letter.&mdash;To live encircled by <i>fears</i>
arising from uncontrolled excesses of the human passions, either
leading to turpitude or terminating in the commission of crimes, <i>is
to live in misery</i>.&mdash;Police is an improved state of Society, which
counteracts these excesses by giving energy and effect to the law. It
is like the Mechanical power applied to an useful Machine, devoid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">-350-</a></span>
which, it remains without motion, or action, and without benefit.</p>

<p>"Government," <i>says the benevolent Hanway</i>, "originates from the love
of order.&mdash;Watered by Police it grows up to maturity, and in course of
time spreads a luxuriant comfort and security.&mdash;Cut off its branches,
and the mere trunk, however strong it may appear, can afford no
shelter."</p>

<p><span class="cap">I</span>NDIGENCE, in the present state of Society, may be considered as a
principal cause of the increase of Crimes.</p>

<p>The System which prevails in the Metropolis, with respect to these
unfortunate individuals who are denominated the <i>Casual Poor</i>, will be
found on minute inquiry to be none of the least considerable of the
causes, which lead to the corruption of morals, and to the
multiplication of minor offences in particular.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">-353-</a></span></p>

<p>The number of persons, who with their families, find their way to the
Metropolis, from the most remote quarters of Great Britain and
Ireland, is inconceivable. In hopes of finding employment they incur
an immediate and constant expence, for lodging and subsistence, until
at length their little all is in the Pawnbrokers' shops, or sold to
raise money for the necessaries of life. If they have been virtuously
brought up in the country, despondency seizes upon their minds, in
consequence of the disappointments and hardships, their adventurous or
incautious conduct has doomed them to suffer; which as it applies to
the most deserving of this class, who will not steal, and are ashamed
to beg, often exceeds any thing that the human mind can conceive.</p>

<p>Their Parochial Settlements are either at a great distance, or perhaps
as natives of Scotland or Ireland, they are without even this
resource. The expence of removing, as the Law directs, is too serious
a charge to be incurred by the parish where accident has fixed them.
They are treated with neglect and contumely by the parochial Officers;
and even occasionally driven to despair. Willing to labour, but bereft
of any channel or medium through which the means of subsistence might
be procured. It is assigned to no person to hear their mournful tale,
who might be able to place them in a situation, where they might gain
a subsistence; and under such circumstances it is much to be feared,
that not a few of them either actually perish for want, or contract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">-354-</a></span>
diseases which ultimately terminate in premature death.</p>

<p>Such is frequently the situation of the more decent and virtuous class
of the labouring people, who come to seek employment in the
Metropolis. The more profligate who pursue the same course have
generally other resources. Where honest labour is not to be procured,
they connect themselves with those who live by petty or more atrocious
offences, and contribute in no small degree to the increase of the
general phalanx of delinquents. The young female part of such families
too often become prostitutes, while the males pursue acts of
depredation upon the Public, by availing themselves of the various
resources, which the defects in the Police System allow.</p>

<p>In addition to the families who thus resort to the Capital, young men
frequently wander up who have become liable to the penalties of the
laws, in consequence of being unable to find security for the support
of a natural Child in their own parish; or who perhaps have incurred
the punishment due to some other offence.&mdash;Without money, without
recommendations, and bereft of friends, and perhaps afraid of being
known, they resort to low public houses, where they meet with thieves
and rogues, who not unfrequently in this way recruit their gangs, as
often as the arm of Justice diminishes their numbers.</p>

<p>But it is to be lamented, that in contemplating the mass of indigence,
which, in its various ramifications,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">-355-</a></span> produces distresses more
extensive and more poignant than perhaps in any other spot in the
world, (Paris excepted) its origin is to be traced in almost every
rank of Society; and though sometimes the result of unavoidable
misfortune, is perhaps more frequently generated by idleness,
inattention to business, and indiscretion. But at all events, the tear
of pity is due to the helpless and forlorn offspring of the criminal
or indolent, who become objects of compassion, not only as it relates
to their immediate subsistence; but much more with respect to their
future situations in life. It is in the progress to the adult state,
that the infants of parents, broken down by misfortunes, almost
unavoidably learn, from the pressure of extreme poverty, to resort to
devices which early corrupt their morals, and mar their future success
and utility in life. Under the influence of these sad examples, and
their necessary consequences, do many females become Prostitutes, who
in other circumstances, might have been an ornament to their sex,
while the males, by contracting early in life habits that are
pernicious, become, in many instances, no less noxious to Society.
Familiarized in infancy to the Pawnbroker's shop, and to other even
less reputable means of obtaining temporary subsistence, they too soon
become adepts in falsehood and deceit. Imperious necessity has given
an early spring to their ingenuity. They are generally full of
resource, which in good pursuits might render them useful and valuable
members of the Community: but unhappily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">-356-</a></span> their minds have acquired a
wrong bias, and they are reared insensibly in the walks of vice,
without knowing, in many instances, that they are at all engaged in
evil pursuits.</p>

<p>In all these points of view, from indigence is to be traced the great
Origin and the Progress of Crimes.</p>

<p>In attending the different <i>Soup Establishments</i> (where 50,000
indigent families, at the expence of one halfpenny per head, have a
meal furnished every day during the winter)<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> the Author has
observed, with a mixture of pain and satisfaction, particularly at one
of them, the children of unfortunate and reduced families, who, from
their appearance, have moved in a higher sphere, the humble suitors
for this frugal and nourishing aliment.</p>

<p>To have contributed in any degree to the relief of distress rendered
painful in the extreme from the recollection of better days, is an
ample reward to those benevolent individuals, who have joined in the
support and conduct of an undertaking, of all others the most
beneficial that perhaps was ever devised, for the purpose of assisting
and relieving suffering humanity.</p>

<p>While the wretchedness, misery and crimes, which have been developed,
and detailed in this work, cannot be sufficiently deplored, it is a
matter of no little exultation, that in no country or nation in the
world, and certainly in no other Metropolis, does there exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">-357-</a></span> among
the higher and middle ranks of Society, an equal portion of
Philanthropy and Benevolence.&mdash;Here are to be discovered the extremes
of vice and virtue, strongly marked by the existing turpitude on one
hand, and the noble instances of charitable munificence, displayed by
the opulent part of the Community, on the other.</p>

<p>Nothing can place this in a stronger point of view, and perhaps
nothing will astonish strangers more than the following summary
Estimate of the various Institutions, supported chiefly by Voluntary
Contributions, in addition to the legal Assessments, all tending to
ameliorate and better the condition of human life, under the
afflicting circumstances of indigence and disease.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>In addition to this, it is highly proper to mention the noble
benevolence, which has been displayed by the Opulent of all ranks, but
particularly the Merchants, in the very large sums which have been, at
various times, subscribed for the relief of the brave men, who have
been maimed and wounded, and for the support of the widows, orphans,
and relations of those who have meritoriously lost their lives in
fighting the battles of their country.</p>

<p>Such exalted examples of unbounded munificence the history of no other
nation records.</p>

<p>It is to this source of elevated virtue, and nobleness of mind, that
an appeal is made, on the present occasion, in behalf of those unhappy
fellow-mortals; who, in spite of the unexampled liberality which has
been displayed, still require the fostering hand of Philanthropy.</p>

<p>The cause of these distresses has been explained; and also the evils
which such a condition in human life entails upon Society. It is not
pecuniary aid that will heal this <i>gangrene</i>: this <i>Corruption of
Morals</i>. There must be the application of a correct System of Police,
calculated to reach the root and origin of the evil.&mdash;Without
<i>System</i>, <i>Intelligence</i>, <i>Talents</i>, and <i>Industry</i>, united in all
that re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">-359-</a></span>lates to the affairs of the Poor, millions may be wasted as
millions have already been wasted, without bettering their condition.
In all the branches of the Science of Political &#338;conomy, there is
none which requires so much skill and knowledge of men and manners, as
that which relates to this particular object: and yet, important as it
is to the best interests of the Community, the management of a
concern, in which the very foundation of the national prosperity is
involved, is suffered to remain, as in the rude ages, when Society had
not assumed the bold features of the present period,&mdash;in the hands of
changeable, and in many instances, unlettered agents; wholly
incompetent to a task at all times nice and difficult in the
execution, and often irksome and inconvenient.</p>

<p>One great feature of this evil, on which it is deplorable to reflect,
is, that nearly one million of the inhabitants of a country, the
utmost population of which is supposed to be short of nine millions,
should be supported in part or in whole by the remaining eight.</p>

<p>In spite of all the ingenious arguments which have been used in favour
of a System admitted to be wisely conceived in its origin, the effects
it has produced incontestably prove, that with respect to the mass of
the Poor, there is something radically wrong in the execution.</p>

<p>If it were not so, it is impossible that there could exist in the
Metropolis such an inconceivable portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">-360-</a></span> of human misery, amidst
examples of munificence and benevolence unparalleled in any age or
country in the world.</p>

<p>Impressed with these sentiments, so far as they apply to the state of
indigence in the Metropolis, a design has been sanctioned by the
<i>Benevolent Society for bettering the Condition of the Poor</i>, the
object of which is to establish a department for inquiring into the
history, life, and the causes of the distress of every person who asks
relief in any part of the Metropolis: not with a view to support these
unfortunate persons in idleness and vice; but to use those means which
talents, attention, and humanity can accomplish&mdash;(means which are
beyond the reach of parochial officers), for the purpose of enabling
them to assist themselves.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">-361-</a></span></p>
<p>In the Metropolis the Magistrates interfere very little in parochial
relief, except when appeals are made to them in particular cases, or
when called upon to sign orders of removal, which is generally done as
a matter of course. Hence it is that the poor are left almost entirely
to the management of the Parochial Officers for the time being, who
frequently act under the influence of ignorance or caprice, or are
irritated by the impudent importunity of the profligate Gin-drinking
poor. These Officers also, it is to be remembered, have private
affairs which necessarily engage the chief part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">-362-</a></span> their attention,
and are frequently no less incapable than unwilling to enter on those
investigations which might enable them to make the proper
discriminations: the modest and shame-faced poor are thus frequently
shut out from relief, while the vociferous and idle succeed in
obtaining pecuniary assistance, which is soon improvidently
dissipated.</p>

<p>The distress which is thus shewn to prevail, by no means arises from
the want of competent funds:&mdash;the misfortune is, that from the nature
of the present mode of management it is not possible to apply these
funds beneficially for the proper relief of those for whom they were
intended. A much more moderate assessment, under a regular and proper
management, would remove great part of the evil.</p>

<p>The expence of the class of persons denominated <i>Casual Poor</i>, who
have no settlement in any parish in the Metropolis, amounts to a large
sum annually.&mdash;In the united parishes of St. Giles in the Fields, and
St. George, Bloomsbury, this expence amounted to 2000<i>l.</i> in the year
1796. It arose from the support of about 1200 poor natives of Ireland,
who but for this aid must have become vagrants. The shocking abuse of
the vagrant passes previous to the year 1792, produced the Act of the
32 Geo. III. cap. 45. which requires that Rogues and Vagabonds should
be first publicly whipt, or confined seven days in the House of
Correction, (females to be imprisoned only, and in no case whipped)
before they are passed, as directed by the Act of the 17 Geo. II. c.
5. Hence it is that so many who are either on the brink of va<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">-363-</a></span>grancy
or have actually received alms, are permitted to remain a burden on
the parishes; the Magistrates being loth to incur the charge of
inhumanity, by strictly following the letter of the Act, in whipping
or imprisoning poor miserable wretches, whose indigence have rendered
relief necessary.</p>

<p>In all the 146 parishes within and without the walls, including the
Bills of Mortality, &amp;c. it is not improbable that the casual charity
given in this way may amount to 10,000<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p>The loose manner in which it is given, and the impossibility either of
a proper discrimination, or of finding in the distributing these
resources, that time for investigation which might lead to the solid
benefit of the Pauper, by restoring him to a capacity of earning his
own livelihood, makes it highly probable that instead of being useful,
this large sum is perhaps hurtful, to the major part of the poor who
receive it. The trifle they receive, from being injudiciously given,
and frequently to get rid of the clamour and importunity of the most
profligate, is too often spent immediately in the Gin-shop.&mdash;No
inquiry is made into the circumstances of the family&mdash;No measures are
pursued to redeem the apparel locked up in the Pawnbrokers' shop,
although a small sum would frequently recover the habiliments of a
naked and starving family&mdash;no questions are asked respecting the means
they employ to subsist themselves by labour; and no efforts are used
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">-364-</a></span> procure employment for those who are willing to labour, but have
not the means of obtaining work.</p>

<p>Hence it is that poverty, under such circumstances, contributes in no
small degree to the multiplication of crimes. The profligate thus
partly supported, too often resorts to pilfering pursuits to fill up
the chasm, and habits of idleness being once obtained, labour soon
becomes irksome.</p>

<p>Why should not the whole nation, but particularly the Metropolis, be
considered, so far at least as regards the vagrant and casual Poor, as
one family, and be placed under the review of certain persons who
might be considered as worthy of the trust, and might devote their
time sedulously to that object?&mdash;Were such an establishment,
instituted, and supported in the first instance by a sum from each
parish, equal to the casual relief they have each given on an average
of the five preceding years, with power to employ this fund in
establishing Houses of Industry, or Work-rooms, in various parts of
the Metropolis, where the Poor should receive the whole of their
earnings and a comfortable meal besides:&mdash;it is highly probable that
while the expence to the parishes would gradually diminish, beggary
would be annihilated in the Metropolis&mdash;the modest and deserving Poor
would be discovered and relieved, while the idle and profligate, who
resorted to begging as a trade, would be compelled to apply to honest
labour for their subsistence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">-365-</a></span></p>

<p>This is a point in the political &#339;conomy of the Nation highly
important, whether it relates to the cause of humanity or to the
morals of the people, upon which all good Governments are
founded.&mdash;That such an institution is practicable is already proved
from the partial experiments that have been made. That the advantages
resulting from it would be great beyond all calculation, is too
obvious to require elucidation.</p>

<p>While it operated beneficially to the lower classes of the people and
to the State, it would relieve Parochial Officers of a very irksome
and laborious task, perhaps the most disagreeable that is attached to
the office of an Overseer in the Metropolis.</p>

<p>To give this branch of Police vigor and effect, the aid of the
Legislature would be necessary; which would be easily obtained when
the measure itself was once thoroughly understood, and it could not
then fail to be as popular as it would unquestionably be useful.</p>

<p>They who from their habits of life have few opportunities of
considering the state of the Poor, are apt to form very erroneous
opinions on the subject.</p>

<p>By <i>the Poor</i> we are not to understand the whole mass of the people
who support themselves by labour; for those whose necessity compels
them to exercise their industry, become by their poverty the actual
pillars of the State.</p>

<p>Labour is absolutely requisite to the existence of all Governments;
and as it is from the Poor only that labour can be expected, so far
from being an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">-366-</a></span> evil they become, under proper regulations, an
advantage to every Country, and highly deserve the fostering care of
every Government. It is not <i>Poverty</i> therefore, that is in itself an
evil, while health, strength, and inclination, afford the means of
subsistence, and while work is to be had by all who seek it.&mdash;The evil
is to be found only in <i>Indigence</i>, where the strength fails, where
disease, age, or infancy, deprives the individual of the means of
subsistence, or where he knows not how to find employment when willing
and able to work.</p>

<p>In this view <i>the Poor</i> may be divided into five Classes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The first Class</i> comprehends what may be denominated <i>the
useful Poor</i>, who are able and willing to work&mdash;who have
already been represented as the pillars of the State, and
who merit the utmost attention of all Governments, with a
direct and immediate view of preventing their <i>poverty</i> from
descending unnecessarily into <i>indigence</i>. As often as this
evil is permitted to happen, the State not only loses an
useful subject, but the expence of his maintenance must be
borne by the Public.&mdash;The great art, therefore, in managing
the affairs of the Poor, is to establish Systems whereby the
poor man, verging upon indigence, may be propped up and kept
in his station. Whenever this can be effected, it is done
upon an average at one-tenth of the expence at most that
must be incurred by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">-367-</a></span> permitting a family to retrograde into
a state of indigence, where they must be wholly maintained
by the Public, and where their own exertions cease in a
great measure to be useful to the Country.</p>

<p><i>The second Class</i> comprehends the <i>vagrant Poor</i>, who are
able but not willing to work, or who cannot obtain
employment in consequence of their bad character. This class
may be said to have descended from poverty into beggary, in
which state they become objects of peculiar attention, since
the State suffers not only the loss of their labour, but
also of the money which they obtain by the present
ill-judged mode of giving charity. Many of them, however,
having become mendicants, more from necessity than choice,
deserve commiseration and attention, and nothing can promote
in a greater degree the cause of humanity, and the real
interest of the Metropolis, than an establishment for the
employment of this class of indigent Poor, who may be said
at present to be in a very deplorable state, those only
excepted who make begging a profession. It is only by a
plan, such as has been recommended, that the real indigent
can be discovered from the vagrant, and in no other way is
it possible to have that distinct and collected view of the
whole class of beggars in the Metropolis, or to provide the
means of rendering their labour (where they are able to
labour) productive to themselves and the State.&mdash;And it may
be further added with great truth, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">-368-</a></span> in no other way is
it possible to prevent the offspring of such mendicants from
becoming <i>Prostitutes</i> and <i>Thieves</i>.</p>

<p>If, therefore, it is of importance to diminish crimes, and
to obstruct the progress of immorality, this part of the
Community ought to be the peculiar objects of a branch of
the National Police, where responsibility would secure an
accurate execution of the System. This measure ought to
begin in the Metropolis as an experiment, and when fully
matured might be extended with every advantage to the
Country.</p>

<p><i>The third Class</i> may be considered under the denomination
of the <i>Indigent Poor</i>, who from want of employment,
<i>sickness, losses</i>, insanity or disease, are unable to
maintain themselves.</p>

<p>In attending to this description of Poor, the first
consideration ought to be to select those who are in a state
to re-occupy their former station among the labouring Poor;
and to restore them to the first class as soon as possible,
by such relief as should enable them to resume their former
employments, and to help themselves and families.</p>

<p>Where insanity, or temporary disease, or infirmity actually
exist, such a course must then be pursued as will enable
such weak and indigent persons, while they are supported at
the expence of the Public, to perform such species of
labour, as may be suited to their peculiar situations,
without operating as a hardship, but rather as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">-369-</a></span>
amusement. In this manner it is wonderful how productive the
exertions of even the most infirm might be rendered.&mdash;But it
must be accomplished under a management very different,
indeed, from any thing which prevails at present.</p>

<p><i>The fourth Class</i> comprehends the <i>aged and infirm</i>, who
are entirely past labour, and have no means of
support.&mdash;Where an honest industrious man has wasted his
strength in labour and endeavours to rear a family, he is
well entitled to an asylum to render the evening of his life
comfortable. For this class the gratitude and the humanity
of the Community ought to provide a retreat separate from
the profligate and vagrant Poor. But, alas! the present
System admits of no such blessing.&mdash;The most deserving most
submit to an indiscriminate intercourse in Workhouses with
the most worthless: whose polluted language and irregular
conduct, render not a few of those asylums as great a
punishment to the decent part of the indigent and infirm as
a common prison.</p>

<p><i>The fifth Class</i> comprises the <i>Infant Poor</i>, who from
extreme indigence, or the death of parents, are cast upon
the public for nurture. One fifth part of the gross number
in a London Workhouse is generally composed of this class.
Their moral and religious education is of the last
importance to the Community. They are the children of the
Public, and if not introduced into life, under circumstances
favourable to the interest of the State,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">-370-</a></span> the error in the
System becomes flagrant.&mdash;Profligate or distressed parents
may educate their children ill; but when those under the
charge of Public Institutions are suffered to become
depraved in their progress to maturity, it is a dreadful
reproach on the Police of the Country.&mdash;And yet what is to
be expected from children reared in Workhouses, with the
evil examples before them of the multitudes of depraved
characters who are constantly admitted into those
receptacles? Young minds are generally more susceptible of
evil than of good impressions; and hence it is that the
rising generation enter upon life with those wicked and
dangerous propensities, which are visible to the attentive
observer in all the walks of vulgar life in this great
Metropolis.</p></div>

<p>The limits of this Treatise will not permit the Author to attempt more
than a mere outline on the general subject of the Poor; a System of
all others the most difficult to manage and arrange with advantage to
the Community; but which is at present unhappily entrusted to the care
of those least competent to the task.</p>

<p>The principle of the Statute of the 43d of Elizabeth is certainly
unobjectionable; but the execution, it must be repeated, is defective.
In short, no part of it has been effectually executed, but that which
relates to raising the assessments. It is easy to make Statutes; but
omnipotent as Parliament is said to be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">-371-</a></span> it cannot give <i>knowledge</i>,
<i>education</i>, <i>public spirit</i>, <i>integrity</i> and <i>time</i>, to those
Changeable Agents whom it has charged with the execution of the Poor
Laws.</p>

<p>In the management of the affairs of the State, the Sovereign wisely
selects men eminent for their talents and integrity:&mdash;Were the choice
to be made on the principle established by the Poor Laws, the Nation
could not exist even a single year.</p>

<p>In the private affairs of life, the success of every difficult
undertaking depends on the degree of abilities employed in the
management. In the affairs of the Poor, the most arduous and intricate
that it is possible to conceive, and where the greatest talents and
knowledge is required, the least portion of either is supplied. How
then can we expect success?&mdash;The error is not in the original design,
which is wise and judicious. The 43d of Elizabeth authorizes an
assessment to be made for three purposes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1st. To purchase Raw Materials to set the Poor to work, who
could not otherwise dispose of their labour.</p>

<p>2d. To usher into the world, advantageously, the Children of
poor people, by binding them apprentices to some useful
employment.</p>

<p>3d. To provide for the lame, impotent and blind, and others,
being poor and not able to work.</p></div>

<p>Nothing can be better imagined than the measures in the view of the
very able framers of this act: but they did not discover that to
execute such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">-372-</a></span> design required powers diametrically opposite to those
which the law provided. The last two centuries have afforded a series
of proof of the total inefficacy of the application of these powers,
not only by the effects which this erroneous superintendence has
produced; but also from the testimony of the most enlightened men who
have written on the subject, from the venerable Lord Hale to the
patriotic and indefatigable Sir Frederick Eden. But the strongest
evidence of the mischiefs arising from this defective execution of a
valuable System, is to be found in the Statute Books themselves.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>"The want of a due provision," says Lord Hale, "for the relief and
education of the Poor in the way of <i>industry</i>, is what fills the
gaols with Malefactors, the Country with idle and unprofitable
persons, that consume the stock of the Kingdom without improving it;
and that will daily increase even to a desolation in time&mdash;and this
error, in the first concoction, is never remediable but by gibbets and
whipping."</p>

<p>That this will continue to be the case under any species of changeable
management, however apparently correct in theory the System may be,
must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">-373-</a></span> appear self-evident to every man of business and observation,
whose attention has been practically directed to the general operation
of the present mode in various parishes, and who has reflected deeply
on the subject.</p>

<p>But to return to the immediate object of inquiry, namely, the means of
more effectually preventing the numerous evils which arise from
indigence and mendicity in the Metropolis, whether excited by idleness
or extreme and unforeseen pressures: Under every circumstance it would
seem impracticable without any burthen upon the Public, to provide for
all such at least as are denominated Casual Poor (from whom the
greatest part of this calamity springs) by adopting the following or
some similar plan, under the sanction of Government, and the authority
of the Legislature.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">That</span> a Public Institution shall be established in the
Metropolis, with <i>three Chief Officers</i>, who shall be
charged with the execution of that branch of the Police,
which relates to <span class="smcap">Street Beggars</span>, and those classes of Poor
who have no legal settlements in the Metropolis, and who now
receive casual relief from the different Parishes, where
they have fixed their residence for the time;&mdash;and that
these principal Officers, (who may be stiled <i>Commissioners
for inquiring into the Cases and Causes of the Distress of
the Poor in the Metropolis</i>) should exercise the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">-374-</a></span></p>

<p class="center">FUNCTIONS:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. To charge themselves with the relief and management of
the whole of the <i>Casual Poor</i>, who at present receive
temporary aid from the different Parishes, or who ask alms
in any part of the Metropolis or its Suburbs.</p>

<p>2d. To provide Work-rooms in various central and convenient
situations in the Metropolis, where persons destitute of
employment may receive a temporary subsistence for labour.
To superintend these work-houses, and become responsible for
the proper management.</p>

<p>3d. To be empowered to give temporary relief to prop up
sinking families, and to prevent their descending from
poverty to indigence, by arresting the influence of
despondency, and keeping the spirit of industry alive.</p>

<p>4th. To assist in binding out the Children of the Poor, or
the Unfortunate, who have seen better days, and preventing
the females from the danger of becoming Prostitutes, or the
males from contracting loose and immoral habits, so as if
possible to save them to their parents, and to the state.</p>

<p>5th. To open offices of inquiry in different parts of the
Metropolis, where all classes of indigent persons, who are
not entitled to parochial relief, will be invited to resort,
for the purpose of being exa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">-375-</a></span>mined, and relieved according
to the peculiar circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>6th. To exercise the legal powers, through the medium of
Constables, for the purpose of compelling all Mendicants,
and idle destitute Boys and Girls who appear in the streets,
to come before the Commissioners for examination; that those
whose industry cannot be made productive, or who cannot be
put in a way to support themselves without alms, may be
passed to their Parishes, while means are employed to bind
out destitute Children to some useful occupation.</p>

<p>7th. To keep a distinct Register of the cases of all
Mendicants or distressed individuals, who may seek advice
and assistance, and to employ such means for alleviating
misery, as the peculiar circumstances may suggest&mdash;never
losing sight of indigence, until an asylum is provided for
the helpless and infirm, and also until the indigent, who
are able to labour, are placed in a situation to render it
productive.</p>

<p>8th. That these Commissioners shall report their proceedings
annually, to his Majesty in Council, and to Parliament; with
abstracts, shewing the numbers who have been examined&mdash;How
disposed of&mdash;The earning of the persons at the different
Work-rooms&mdash;The annual expence of the Establishment;
together with a general view of the advantages resulting
from it; with the proofs of these advantages.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">-376-</a></span></p>

<p>Towards defraying the whole expence of this Establishment it is
proposed, that (in lieu of the Casual Charity, paid at present by all
the Parishes in the Metropolis, which under this System will cease,
together with the immense trouble attached to it,) each Parish in the
Metropolis shall pay into the hands of the Receiver of the Funds of
this <i>Pauper Police Institution</i>, a sum equal to what was formerly
disbursed in casual relief, which for the purpose of elucidation, is
estimated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="parishes">

<tr><td class="rtbl">146</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td class="rtbl">£.5,230</td><td class="rtbl">0</td><td class="rtbl">0</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This sum (which is supposed to be not much above one half of the
average Annual disbursements of the 146 Parishes above-mentioned;
especially since it has been shewn, that the expence in St. Giles' and
St. George Bloomsbury alone, has been 2000<i>l.</i> in one year) will
probably, with &#339;conomy and good management, be found sufficient for
all the relief that is required; more especially as the object is not
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">-377-</a></span> maintain the indigent, but to put them in a way of supporting
themselves by occasional pecuniary aids well and judiciously applied.</p>

<p>The experiment is certainly worth trying. In its execution some of the
most respectable and intelligent individuals in the Metropolis, would
gratuitously assist the Commissioners, who as taking responsibility
upon them, in the direction of a most important branch of Police,
ought undoubtedly to be remunerated by Government, especially as it is
scarcely possible to conceive any mode in which the Public money could
be applied, that would be productive of such benefit to the State.</p>

<p>If that utility resulted from the design, which may reasonably be
expected, it would of course extend to other great towns, as the
private <i>Soup Establishments</i> have done, and the condition of the poor
would undergo a rapid change. The destitute and forlorn would then
have some means of communicating their distress, while information and
facts of the greatest importance, to the best interests of Society,
would spring from this source.</p>

<p>With respect to the general affairs of the poor, much good would arise
from consolidating the funds of all the parishes in the Metropolis.</p>

<p>The poor for instance, who are supported from the parochial funds of
Bethnal Green, and other distressed parishes in the eastern parts of
the Metropolis, are the labourers of the citizens and inhabitants of
the 97 Parishes within the Walls, who, although opulent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">-378-</a></span> pay little or
nothing to the Poor, since the city affords no cottages to lodge them.</p>

<p>Why, therefore, should not the inhabitants of the rich parishes
contribute to the relief of the distresses of those who waste their
strength in contributing to their <i>ease</i>, <i>comfort</i>, and <i>profit</i>? In
several of the most populous Parishes and Hamlets in the eastern part
of the Town, the Poor may actually be said to be assessed to support
the indigent. In the very populous Hamlet of Mile-End New Town, where
there is scarcely an inhabitant who does not derive his subsistence
from some kind of labour, the rates are treble the assessments in
Mary-le-bone, where opulence abounds. Nothing can exceed the
inequality of the weight for the support of the Poor in the
Metropolis; since where the demand is greatest, the means of supply
are always most deficient and inadequate.</p>

<p>Certain it is that the whole system admits of much improvement, and
perhaps at no period, since the Poor Laws have attracted attention,
did there exist so many able and intelligent individuals as at
present, who have been excited by motives of patriotism and
philanthropy, to devote their time to the subject.</p>

<p>At the head of this most Respectable Group stands Sir <span class="smcap">Frederick Eden</span>;
a gentleman, whose entrance into life, has been marked by a display of
the most useful talents, manifested by an extent of labour and
perseverance, in his elaborate work on the Poor, which may be said to
be unparalleled in point of in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">-379-</a></span>formation, while it unquestionably
exhibits the respectable Author as a character in whose patriotism and
abilities the State will find a considerable resource, in whatever
tends to assist his Country, or to improve the condition of Human
Life.</p>

<p>To the Lord Bishop of Durham, the Earl of Winchelsea, Count Rumford,
Sir William Young, Thos. Ruggles, Esq. William Morton Pitt, Esq.
Jeremy Bentham, Esq. Robert Saunders, Esq. Thomas Bernard, Esq.
William Wilberforce, Esq. Rowland Burdon, Esq. the Rev. Dr. Glasse,
the Rev. Thomas Gisburn, the Rev. Mr. Howlet, Mr. Davis, Mr. Townsend,
Arthur Young, Esq. and William Sabatier, Esq. as well as several other
respectable living characters, who have particularly turned their
thoughts to the subject of the Poor, the Public are not only already
much indebted, but from this prolific resource of judgment, talents,
and knowledge, much good might be expected, if ever the period shall
arrive when the revision of the Poor Laws shall engage the attention
of the Legislature.</p>

<p>The measure is too complicated to be adjusted by men, who have not
opportunities or leisure to contemplate its infinite ramifications.</p>

<p>It is a task which can only be executed with accuracy by those, who
completely understand the subject as well in practice as in theory,
and who can bestow the time requisite for those laborious
investigations, which must be absolutely necessary to form a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">-380-</a></span> final
opinion, and to report to Parliament what is most expedient, under all
circumstances, to be done in this important National Concern.</p>

<p>Happy is it for the country, that a resource exists for the attainment
of this object, than which nothing can contribute, in a greater
degree, to the prevention of Crimes, and to the general improvement of
Civil Society.</p>

<hr class="dbl1" />
<hr class="dbl2" />

<p><span class="cap">A</span>S it must be admitted, that the evils arising from the multiplied
crimes detailed in the preceding Chapters, render a correct and
energetic System of Police with regard to the <i>detection</i>,
<i>discovery</i>, and <i>apprehension</i> of offenders, indispensably necessary
for the safety and well-being of Society; it follows of course, in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">-383-</a></span> order of this Work, to explain <i>how this branch of the public
service is conducted at present, the defects which are apparent,&mdash;and
the means of improving the System</i>.</p>

<p>When robberies or burglaries have been committed in or near the
Metropolis, where the property is of considerable value, the usual
method at present, is to apply to the City Magistrates, if in London;
or otherwise, to the Justices at one of the Public Offices,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and to
publish an Advertisement offering a reward on the recovery of the
articles stolen, and the conviction of the offenders.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">-384-</a></span></p><p>In many cases of importance, to the reproach of the Police, recourse
is had to noted and known Receivers of stolen Goods for their
assistance in discovering such offenders, and of pointing out the
means by which the property may be recovered: this has on many
occasions been productive of success to the parties who have been
robbed; as well as to the ends of public justice; for however
lamentable it is to think that Magistrates are compelled to have
recourse to such expedients, yet while the present System continues,
and while robberies and burglaries are so frequent, without the means
of prevention, there is no alternative on many occasions <i>but to
employ a thief to catch a thief</i>.</p>

<p>It is indeed so far fortunate, that when the influence of Magistrates
is judiciously and zealously employed in this way, it is productive in
many instances of considerable success, not only in the recovery of
property stolen, but also in the detection and punishment of atrocious
offenders.</p>

<p>Wherever activity and zeal are manifested on the part of the
Magistrates, the Peace Officers, under their immediate direction,
seldom fail to exhibit a similar desire to promote the ends of public
justice. And when it is considered that these Officers, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">-385-</a></span> they
conduct themselves with purity, are truly <i>the safeguards of the
Community</i>, destined to protect the Public against the outrages and
lawless depredations of a set of miscreants, who are the declared
enemies of the State, by making war upon all ranks of the body
politic, who have property to lose;&mdash;they have a fair claim, while
they act properly, to be esteemed as "<i>the civil defenders of the
lives and properties of the People</i>."</p>

<p>Every thing that can heighten in any degree the respectability of the
office of <i>Constable</i>, adds to the security of the State, and the
safety of the life and property of every individual.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, it cannot be sufficiently regretted that
these useful constitutional officers, destined for the protection of
the Public, have been (with a very few exceptions) so little regarded,
so carelessly selected, and so ill supported and rewarded for the
imminent risques which they run, and the services they perform in the
execution of their duty.</p>

<p>The common Law, as well as the ancient Statutes of the kingdom, having
placed extensive powers in the hands of <i>Constables</i> and <i>Peace
Officers</i>;&mdash;they are, in this point of view, to be considered as
<i>respectable</i>;&mdash;and it is the interest of the Community, that they
should support that rank and character in society, which corresponds
with the authority with which they are invested.&mdash;If this were
attended to, men of credit and discretion would not be so averse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">-386-</a></span>
fill such situations; and those pernicious prejudices, which have
prevailed in vulgar life, and in some degree among the higher ranks in
Society, with regard to <i>thief-takers</i>, would no longer operate; for
it is plain to demonstration, "<i>that the best laws that ever were made
can avail nothing, if the Public Mind is impressed with an idea, that
it is a matter of infamy, to become the casual or professional agents
to carry them into execution</i>."</p>

<p>This absurd prejudice against the office of Constable, and the small
encouragement which the major part receive, is one of the chief
reasons why unworthy characters have filled such situations; and why
the public interest has suffered by the increase of crimes.</p>

<p>The office of Constable is as old as the Monarchy of England;&mdash;and
certainly existed in the time of the Saxons.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>&mdash;The law requires
that he should be <i>idoneus homo</i>: or in other words, <i>to have honesty
to execute the office without malice, affection, or partiality;
knowledge to understand what he ought to do; and ability, as well in
substance or estate, as in body</i>, to enable him to conduct himself
with utility to the public.</p>

<p>The Statute of Winchester, made in the 13th year of Edward the First
(anno 1285) appoints two Constables to be chosen in every Hundred; and
such seems to have been the attention of the Legislature to the Police
of the Country at that early period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">-387-</a></span> our history, "<i>that suspicious
night-walkers are ordered to be arrested and detained by the
watch</i>."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The Statute of 5 Edward III. <i>cap.</i> 14, (anno 1332) empowers
Constables "<i>to arrest persons suspected of man-slaughter, felonies,
and robberies, and to deliver them to the Sheriff, to be kept in
prison till the coming of the Justices</i>:" and another Act of the 34th
of the same reign, <i>cap.</i> 1, (made anno 1361,) empowers Justices,
(<i>inter alia</i>) "<i>to inquire after wanderers, to arrest and imprison
suspicious persons, and to oblige persons of evil fame to give
security for good behaviour; so that the People may not be troubled by
rioters, nor the peace blemished; nor Merchants and others travelling
on the highways be disturbed or put in peril by such offenders</i>."</p>

<p>By the common law, every person committing a felony may be arrested by
any person whomsoever present at the fact, who may secure the prisoner
in gaol, or carry him before a Magistrate,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>&mdash;and if a prisoner
thus circumstanced, resists and refuses to yield, those who arrest
will be justified in the beating him,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> or, in case of absolute
necessity, even killing him.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>In arresting persons on suspicion of a felony, actually committed,
<i>common fame</i> has been adjudged to be a reasonable cause.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>There are four methods, known in law, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">-388-</a></span> Officers of Justice,
as well as private individuals, may arrest persons charged with
felony.&mdash;1. <i>By the warrant of a Magistrate.</i>&mdash;2. <i>By an Officer
without a warrant.</i>&mdash;3. <i>By a Private Person without a warrant.</i>&mdash;And
4. <i>By Hue-and-Cry.</i><a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>When a warrant is received by an Officer, he is bound to execute it,
so far as the jurisdiction of the Magistrate and himself extends.&mdash;But
the <i>Constable</i> having great original and inherent authority, may,
<i>without warrant</i>, apprehend any person for a breach of the Peace: and
in case of felony, <i>actually committed</i>, he may, on probable
suspicion, arrest the felon: and for that purpose (as upon the warrant
of a Magistrate,) he is authorised to break open doors, and even
justified in killing the felon, if he cannot otherwise be taken.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>All persons present, when a felony is committed, are bound to arrest
the felon, on pain of fine and imprisonment, if he escapes through
negligence of the by-standers; who will (the same as a constable) in
such case be justified in breaking open doors, to follow such felon,
and even to kill him if he cannot be taken otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The other species of arrest is called <i>Hue-and-Cry</i>, which is an
<i>alarm raised in the country</i> upon any felony being committed. This
was an ancient practice in use as far back as the reign of Edward the
First, (1285) by which, in the then infant state of society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">-389-</a></span> it
became easy to discover criminal persons flying from justice.</p>

<p>However doubtful the utility of this ancient method of detecting
offenders may be, in a great Metropolis, in the present extended state
of Society, it is plain, that it has been considered as an important
regulation of Police so late as the 8th George II. (1735;) since it
was enacted in that year, (stat. 8, George II. cap. 16.) that the
Constable who neglects making <i>hue-and-cry</i>, shall forfeit five
pounds; and even the district is liable to be fined (according to the
law of Alfred) if the felony be committed therein, and the felon
escapes.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> This, however, applies more particularly to the country,
and where the practice cannot fail to be useful in a certain degree.</p>

<p>When a <i>hue-and-cry</i> is raised, every person, by command of the
Constable, must pursue the felon, on pain of fine and imprisonment.</p>

<p>In this pursuit also, Constables may search suspected houses if the
doors be open: <i>but unless the felon is actually in the house</i>, it
will not be justifiable to use force; nor even then, except where
admittance has been demanded and refused.</p>

<p>A Constable, even without any warrant, may break open a door for the
purpose of apprehending a felon; but to justify this measure, he must
not only shew that the felon was in the house, but also that access
was denied after giving notice that he was a Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">-390-</a></span>stable, and demanding
admittance in that capacity.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> In the execution of the warrant of a
Magistrate, the Officer is certainly authorized to break open the
doors of the felon, or of the house of any person where he is
concealed.&mdash;The first is lawful under all circumstances; but forcibly
entering the house of a stranger may be considered as a trespass, if
the felon should not be there.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Such are the powers with which Constables are invested,&mdash;and which
are, in many instances, enforced by penalties; that public justice may
not be defeated.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>In addition to this, the wisdom of the Legislature, as an
encouragement to officers and others to do their duty in apprehending
and prosecuting offenders, has granted rewards in certain cases;
<i>Namely</i>,</p>

<p>These rewards apply to ten different offences, and ought, no doubt, to
be a considerable spur to Officers to do their duty; but it may be
doubted whether this measure has not, in some degree, tended to the
increase of a multitude of smaller crimes which are pregnant with the
greatest mischiefs to Society.&mdash;It is by deterring men from the
commission of <i>smaller</i> crimes (says the Marquis Beccaria) that
<i>greater</i> ones are prevented.</p>

<p>If small rewards were given in cases of <i>Grand Larceny</i>, (now very
numerous,) as well as of several other felonies, frauds, and
misdemeanors, a species of activity would enter into the system of
detection, which has not heretofore been experienced.</p>

<p>While rewards are limited to higher offences, and <span class="smcap">conviction</span> <i>is the
indispensable condition upon which they are granted</i>, it is much to be
feared that lesser crimes are overlooked; and the Public subjected, in
many instances, to the intermediate depredations of a rogue, from his
first starting upon the town until he shall be worth 40<i>l.</i></p>

<p>This system of giving high rewards only on conviction, also tends to
weaken evidence: since it is obvious that the Counsel for all
Prisoners, whose offences entitle the Prosecutors and Officers to a
re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">-393-</a></span>ward, generally endeavour to impress upon the minds of the Jury an
idea, that witnesses, who have a pecuniary interest in the conviction
of any offender standing upon trial, are not, on all occasions,
deserving of full credit, unless strongly corroborated by other
evidence; and thus many notorious offenders often escape justice.</p>

<p>By altering the system entirely, and leaving it in the breast of the
Judge who tries the offence, to determine what reward shall be
allowed, with a power to <i>grant</i> or <i>withhold</i>, or to <i>limit</i> and
<i>increase the same</i>, according to circumstances connected with the
trouble and risk of the parties, <i>whether there is a conviction or
not</i>, a fairer measure of recompence would be dealt out;&mdash;the public
money would be more beneficially distributed,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> so as to excite
general activity in checking every species of criminality;&mdash;and the
objections, now urged against Officers and Prosecutors as interested
witnesses, would, by this arrangement, be completely obviated.</p>

<p>For the purpose of elucidating these suggestions, it may be useful to
examine the different offences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">-394-</a></span> which constitute the aggregate of the
charges made against criminals arraigned at the Old Bailey, in the
course of a year.</p>

<p>With this view the following statement is offered to the consideration
of the Reader.&mdash;It refers to a period of profound peace (as most
likely to exhibit a true average) and contains a register of the
trials, published by authority, including eight sessions from
September 1790 to 1791. From this it appears that 1088 prisoners were
tried for different offences in that year, and that 711 were
<i>discharged</i>! and yet, striking as this may appear, it may be asserted
on good grounds, that the following melancholy Catalogue (extensive as
it seems to be) does not probably contain even <i>one-tenth part</i> of the
offences which are actually committed!</p>

<p>Thus it appears that murders, as well as several other very atrocious
crimes, are committed, where officers of justice are not entitled to
any reward for their trouble and risque in apprehending the offenders.</p>

<p>Receivers of stolen Goods in particular, who, as has been repeatedly
stated, are <i>the nourishers and supporters of thieves</i>, and who, of
all other offenders, are of that class where the greatest benefit to
the public is to arise from their discovery and apprehension, seem to
be totally overlooked.</p>

<p>If it should be thought too loose a system to allow rewards <i>not
exceeding a certain sum in any one case</i>, to be distributed according
to the discretion of the Judges who try the offence; perhaps it might
be possible <i>to form a scale of premiums</i> from <i>one guinea up to fifty
pounds</i>, which, by holding out certain encouragement <i>in all cases
whatsoever</i>, might not only excite a desire on the part of men of some
property and respectability to become Officers of Justice: but would
create that species of <i>constant vigilance and attention</i> to the means
of apprehending every class of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">-397-</a></span> offenders, which cannot be expected at
present, while the rewards are so limited.</p>

<p>The <i>Officers of Justice</i>, (parochial and stipendiary) who are
appointed to watch over the Police of the Metropolis and its environs,
in keeping the peace, and in detecting and apprehending offenders,
amount at present (as near as possible) to 1040 individuals, under
five separate jurisdictions, <i>and are arranged as follows</i>:</p>

<p>Of these 1040 Officers the Reader will observe, that only 89
(exclusive of the thirty-two extra officers in the City of London; and
the sixty-eight patroles at Bow-street; making in the whole no more
than 189,) <i>are Stipendiary Officers</i>, particularly pledged to devote
their whole time to the service of the Public:&mdash;and hence a question
arises, Whether so small a number are sufficient for the purpose of
watching and detecting the hordes of villains who infest the
Metropolis, and who must be considerably increased on the return of
peace?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">-400-</a></span></p>

<p>Little assistance can be expected under the present System from
parochial officers; who, depending on their daily labour principally
for their support, can afford to devote no more time than is
absolutely necessary for their indispensable duties, during the 12
months they are in office: and more especially since Magistrates have
no power, or funds, to remunerate such parochial officers for
extraordinary exertions in the Public service, however meritorious
they may be;&mdash;hence it is, that their zeal and activity are checked in
many instances; when under proper regulations (such as are hereafter
suggested) and subject to a certain degree of control and discipline,
and properly remunerated for their services they might be rendered
extremely useful. These facts, joined to the further elucidation of
this particular branch of the subject, it is earnestly to be hoped,
may produce an arrangement of more <i>energy</i> and <i>effect</i> than exists
under the present system.</p>

<p>Officers of Justice, who are subjected not only to considerable risks,
but also to want of rest, and to the inconvenience of being exposed
much in the night-time, ought certainly to be liberally paid; so as to
make it an object to <i>good</i> and <i>able men</i> even to look up to such
situations.</p>

<p>It having been thus shewn that the Stipendiary Constables are so
inconsiderable in point of numbers, and their duty confined to
particular objects, it follows that on the parochial officers the
Public ought, in a considerable degree, to depend for the general
prevention of offences, and particularly for defeating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">-401-</a></span> the crafty and
iniquitous devices which are resorted to for the purpose of evading
the operation of justice.&mdash;These men also from their local knowledge
are, or ought to be, best qualified to procure accurate information,
and to supply what may be necessary to enable Magistrates to discharge
their duty with advantage to the Community, and by this means they
might be rendered useful auxiliaries to the existing Police.</p>

<p>It would seem, therefore, of the highest importance that arrangements
should be formed, calculated to give to these constitutional
safe-guards of the peaceful subject, that utility, energy, and effect,
which originally resulted from the exercise of their functions,&mdash;which
the present state of Society imperiously calls for, and without which
the preventive System of Police can never be effectual.</p>

<p>On looking accurately into the nature and effect of the institution of
Constables, it will be found that the vigor and efficacy of the Civil
Power, the security of innocence,&mdash;the preservation of good order, and
the attainment of justice, depend in a great measure on the accuracy
of the System, with respect to these Officers assigned to keep the
peace in the respective parishes of the Metropolis; and it is because
the original spirit of the design has been, in so many instances,
abandoned that crimes have multiplied, and that the public are so
insecure.</p>

<p>The evil, however, admits of practicable remedies, which the
Superintending Board of Police, recom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">-402-</a></span>mended by the Select Committee
of the House of Commons, might considerably facilitate, by methodizing
the general design, and giving strength, intelligence, and uniformity
to the whole.</p>

<p>Preparatory to this object, however, the System in the respective
parishes must be greatly improved, before a co-operation can be
expected that will prove extensively beneficial to the Public.</p>

<p>The first step to be pursued, is to establish a fund for the
remuneration of Constables of every description. It will not be
difficult to demonstrate that a resource may be found for this
purpose, which will not impose any new burden on the Country, provided
these Officers do their duty.</p>

<p>The enormous expence at present incurred, and which is either defrayed
from the County Rates, or the general Revenue of the Country, arises
chiefly after offenders are detected and punished. Out of 234,153<i>l.</i>
a year stated by the Committee on Finance, to be the annual amount of
the Police expences, only 26,183<i>l.</i> is incurred previous to
detection.&mdash;By diminishing crimes, therefore, the chief part of the
burden upon the Country will be taken away; and hence in this saving
will be established a resource for the remuneration of those who may
contribute to so important an object.</p>

<p>The present expenditure of the County Rates for criminal offences, is
estimated to amount to 50,000<i>l.</i> a year. In proportion as offences
diminish, through the medium of a well-organized and energetic
Po<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">-403-</a></span>lice, will this burden upon the Poor Rates also be diminished.</p>

<p>Independent, therefore, of the policy of improving the system with
respect to parochial Constables, by attaching a greater degree of
responsibility to their situation, and introducing that discipline and
systematic activity, which can alone render their services
effectual&mdash;the plan may even be recommended as a proper arrangement in
point of &#339;conomy.</p>

<p>It is in vain to expect energy or attention in the execution of any
Public duty, unless there be that personal responsibility which is not
to be obtained without emolument. To render Officers of Justice,
therefore, useful to the Public, they must be stimulated by
interest:&mdash;they must, in fact, be paid for devoting a portion of their
time to the comfort and security of others. The Law may inflict, and,
indeed, has inflicted, penalties for the neglect of specific duties;
but this will not establish that sort of Police which the present
state of Society requires.&mdash;This is strongly exemplified in what may
not be improperly called the <i>Mockery of Police</i>, which is exhibited
in the periodical presentments by Constables, of public grievances and
nuisances, before the Grand Inquest, four times a year at
Westminster-hall, and twice before the Magistrates of the Sessions
held at Guildhall in the City of Westminster. These presentments,
although in themselves of the highest importance, have degenerated
into what may now be considered as an useless and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">-404-</a></span> burdensome
formality; at best it is a tedious, expensive, and circuitous, mode of
removing nuisances and inconveniences, and so ill-suited to the
present state of Society, that several modern parochial Acts have
given relief in a summary way before Magistrates.</p>

<p>The fact is, that in a great majority of instances where presentments
are made, the evils they describe, though often highly prejudicial,
are suffered to accumulate with increasing malignity, at the same time
frequently generating other mischiefs and pressures of a tendency
equally pernicious to the Community.</p>

<p>It is admitted, that the proper Officer of the Crown notifies to the
parties implicated in the presentment, the determination of the
Inquest; but a prosecution seldom ensues. The Constable has neither
money nor time to follow it up; and the matter is discharged when the
customary term expires, on the payment of a Fee of 16<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> or
more, according to the length of the presentment; and thus the
business terminates in the emolument of an individual, and in the
continuance of the abuse.</p>

<p>The same system prevails at the Sessions at Westminster. When Juries
make presentments of nuisances or evils in their respective districts,
the Constables have general orders to prosecute, which is not done;
and, indeed, to compel an Officer serving gratuitously, to incur an
expence for the Public interest which he cannot afford, would be an
act of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">-405-</a></span> manifest injustice; and unless a fund be provided in numerous
cases, he must be under the necessity of declining such prosecutions.</p>

<p>But would it not be far better to bring such minor offences at once
under the cognizance of Magistrates, with the power of appeal to the
Quarter Sessions?&mdash;This is already the case in Spitalfields, under a
parochial Act, where nuisances and annoyances are in consequence
instantly removed. Matters of much greater importance are submitted to
the same authority. The advantage in this case would be, that justice
would be promptly administered at a small expence, and the evil would
be put an end to, instead of remaining as at present a reproach to the
Police, arming at the same time every noxious and bad member of
Society, with a kind of licence to do offensive acts to the
neighbourhood, and the Public at large, with impunity.</p>

<p>To render parochial Constables useful, rules must be established to
compel every qualified person to serve in his turn, or pay a fine. No
person should be empowered to offer a Substitute.&mdash;It is of the
highest importance that an Office invested with so much power should
be executed by reputable men, if possible of pure morals, and not with
hands open to receive bribes.&mdash;This important office in the Metropolis
at least, has too long been degraded by the introduction, in many
instances, of men of loose principles, undeserving of public
confidence. The reason is obvious:&mdash;A man in the more reputable
classes on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">-406-</a></span> whom the lot may fall, surrenders his functions to a
Substitute who probably makes the office a trade;&mdash;performs the
service of the year for four or five Guineas, trusting to other
emoluments, many of which are obtained by corruption, to enable him to
subsist.</p>

<p>To render this branch of Police pure and efficient, an Act of
Parliament should enforce the following or similar regulations:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1st. To assign a competent number of local Constables to
each parish, in proportion to the number of inhabited
houses; to be chosen by the whole number of qualified
inhabitants paying parish Rates&mdash;to be presented to the
Court Leet, or to the Magistrates of the Division, according
to a prescribed rule, which shall preclude the possibility
of exemptions or preferences; for which purposes the
qualifications shall be clearly defined in the Act.&mdash;Thus
might the abuses which at present prevail, in the selection
and choice of Constables, cease to be felt and complained
of: an equal distribution of the burden would take place,
and the duty be confined to men sufficiently respectable, to
establish in the Public mind a confidence that it would be
executed with fidelity, and an attention to the Public
interest.</p>

<p>2d. That with a view to that necessary discipline, and
knowledge of the duty to be performed, without which
Officers of Justice can be of little use,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">-407-</a></span> and may often be
converted into instruments of oppression by an abuse of
power; the High-Constable of the Division shall become <i>a
responsible permanent Officer</i>, with a competent Salary; and
shall have under his direction certain subordinate Officers,
not exceeding <i>one for a large Parish</i>, and <i>one for every</i>
25 <i>Constables in any number of smaller Parishes, Hamlets,
Precincts, and Liberties</i>, who shall be stiled <i>the
Parochial Chief Constable</i>, whose situation shall also <i>be
permanent</i>, with a moderate Salary, and who shall each be
<i>responsible</i> for the execution of the regular duty which
may be assigned to the petty Constables, either by the Act
of Parliament, or by the Commissioners of Police, having
powers for that purpose granted by law.&mdash;That a certain
stipend or gratuity for trouble, shall also be paid to each
of the petty Constables, in consideration of the ordinary
duty they are bound to perform, besides 5<i>s.</i> a day for all
extraordinary duty. That among other things it shall be the
business of the parochial Chief Constable to instruct the
petty Constables in their duty&mdash;to attend them in their
perambulations, and to marshal them on receiving a precept
from the High-Constable, or an order from two Magistrates,
in case of any tumult or disorder requiring their
interference&mdash;to impress upon their minds the necessity of
purity, vigilance, and attention to orders&mdash;and of being
humane, prudent and vigorous, in the execution of such
duties as belong to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">-408-</a></span> their functions.&mdash;That they shall
instantly assemble on any alarm of Fire.&mdash;That the
Public-houses, in the parish or district, shall be visited
regularly; and also the Watchmen while upon duty, and
regular returns made to the Police Magistrates of the
District, stating the occurrences of the night. That
wherever suspicious characters reside in the parish, who
have no visible means of supporting themselves, the utmost
vigilance shall be exercised in watching their conduct, to
prevent as much as possible the commission of crimes, and to
preserve peace and good order in the parish; and wherever
the execution of any specific law depends on Constables, the
utmost attention to be manifested in giving it effect, and
preventing it from remaining a dead Letter.&mdash;That care be
taken to make regular, impartial, and accurate returns of
Jurors; and of persons eligible to serve in the
Militia;&mdash;and that immediate cognizance be also taken of all
nuisances and annoyances, and timely notice given to
Magistrates of all occurrences threatening to disturb the
Public peace, or to overturn the established Government of
the Country.</p>

<p>3d. That the different High Constables should return to the
Commissioners of Police annually, after a change of Officers
has taken place, a list of the number of persons who compose
the Civil Force, under their direction in their respective
divisions; and regularly, every quarter, a list of the
Publicans, with such facts as have occurred, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">-409-</a></span>specting
their orderly or disorderly conduct in the management of
their Houses.&mdash;The state of the Division with respect to
Prostitutes&mdash;to the situation of the Poor for the preceding
quarter, and their resource for employment.&mdash;The number and
nature of the offences committed in the District during the
preceding quarter, and the detections of the delinquents,
shewing how many offenders have been discovered, and how
many have escaped justice, and stating the means used and
using to detect such as are at large, charged with specific
offences within the division: so as to bring under the
review of the Central Board a clear statement of the
criminal Police in every part of the Metropolis on the first
day of each quarter, with such other information as the
Commissioners may require.</p>

<p>4th. It is humbly suggested, that the Salaries and
allowances to be paid to the <i>High Constables</i> and
<i>parochial Chief Constables</i> should be paid out of the
General Police Fund, under the Management of the Board, and
the gratuities and allowances to the petty Constables out of
the County Rate.</p></div>

<p>It might be expedient that the Stipend of the petty Constables should
be very moderate, and that their remunerations should, partly at
least, arise from <i>premiums</i> and <i>gratuities</i>, granted by the Judges
and Magistrates, for meritorious services to the Public,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">-410-</a></span> <i>actually
performed</i>; for which there would so many opportunities occur, that no
fit man, acting as a Constable under such a system, and doing his duty
conscientiously, need be under any apprehension of obtaining a very
comfortable livelihood.</p>

<p>The invariable rule of rewarding, in every case where it can be made
appear that any useful Public service has been performed, would have a
most wonderful effect in preventing crimes: The expence, if
judiciously and &#339;conomically managed, need not exceed, in any
material degree, <i>the present aggregate</i> of what is disbursed in
different ways, in all the branches of the Police and Criminal
Establishment; it might, in fact, be defrayed, as well as every other
charge, <i>by the Police itself</i>, under the direction of the <i>Central
Board</i>, hereafter more particularly alluded to, from the produce of
the <i>Licences</i> proposed to be granted for regulating particular
classes of Dealers, by whose aid and assistance, in supporting Thieves
and Pilferers, such a system is rendered necessary.</p>

<p>Nor should the rewards be wholly confined to Officers of Justice,
either <i>parochial or stipendiary</i>. The Public Good requires, that they
should extend also to Watchmen and Patroles, who should have every
reasonable encouragement held out to them to be honest and vigilant,
by small premiums paid down immediately, for every service they may
render the Public; either in detecting or apprehending persons who are
guilty of felonies, or other offences against the public peace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">-411-</a></span></p>

<p>At present, the watchmen destined to guard the lives and properties of
the inhabitants residing in near <i>eight thousand</i> streets, lanes,
courts, and alleys, and about 160,000 houses, composing the whole of
the Metropolis and its environs, are under the direction of no less
than above seventy different Trusts; regulated by perhaps double the
number of local acts of Parliament, (varying in many particulars from
one another,) under which the <i>directors</i>, <i>guardians</i>, <i>governors</i>,
<i>trustees</i>, or <i>vestries</i>, according to the title they assume, are
authorised to act,&mdash;each attending only to their own particular
<i>Ward</i>, <i>Parish</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Liberty</i>, or <i>Precinct</i>; and varying the
payment according to local circumstances, and the opulence of the
particular district, from 8&frac12;<i>d.</i> up to 2<i>s.</i> each night.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>The encouragement being, in many instances, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">-412-</a></span> small, few candidates
appear for such situations, who are really, in point of character and
age, fit for the duty which ought to be performed; the managers have
therefore no alternative but to accept of such aged, and often
superannuated, men, living in their respective districts, as may offer
their services; this they are frequently induced to do from motives of
humanity, to assist old inhabitants who are unable to labour at any
mechanical employment, or perhaps with a view to keep them out of the
workhouse, and to save the expence of maintaining them.</p>

<p>Thus circumstanced, and thus encouraged, what can be expected from
such watchmen?&mdash;</p>

<p>Aged in general;&mdash;often feeble:&mdash;and almost, on every occasion, half
starved, from the limited allowance they receive; without any claim
upon the Public, or the least hope of reward held out, even if they
perform any meritorious service, by the <i>detection of Thieves and
Receivers of stolen Goods</i>, or idle and disorderly persons: and above
all, <i>making so many separate parts of an immense system, without any
general superintendance, disjointed from the nature of its
organization</i>, it is only a matter of wonder, that the protection
afforded is what <i>it really is</i>.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>&mdash;Not only is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">-413-</a></span> there small
encouragement offered for the purpose of insuring fidelity, but as has
been already shewn innumerable temptations are held out to dishonesty,
by Receivers of stolen Goods, to the watchmen and patroles in their
vicinity; as well as by thieves and housebreakers in all situations
where they contemplate the commission of a burglary.</p>

<p>Money is also received from disorderly persons in the night, to permit
them to escape from the just punishment of the Laws; while on the
other hand, unfortunate females are often cruelly oppressed and laid
under contribution, for permission to infringe the very laws, which it
is the duty of these nocturnal guardians of the Police to put in
execution.</p>

<p>Excepting in the city of London, under the jurisdiction of the Lord
Mayor and Aldermen, (where there are, in the 25 wards, 765 watchmen,
and 38 patroles) and the parishes and liberties combined by the act of
the 14th Geo. III. cap. 90, it will not be easy to ascertain the exact
number of watchmen, &amp;c. employed by the great variety of different
Trusts, in every part of the Metropolis; more especially, as in
several instances they vary in their numbers according to the season
of the year, and other circumstances; but the following statement is
believed to be very near truth:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">-414-</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Nothing can certainly be better calculated for <i>complete protection</i>
against acts of violence in the streets, than <i>the System of a
well-regulated Stationary Watch</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">-415-</a></span> composed of fit and able-bodied
men, properly controlled and superintended: and from the number of
persons already employed, independent of private Watchmen, it would
seem only to be necessary to lay down apposite legislative rules, with
respect to <i>age or ability</i>, <i>character</i>, <i>wages</i>, <i>rewards for useful
services</i>, and <i>general superintendance</i>, in order to establish that
species of additional security, which would operate as a more
effectual means of preventing crimes within the Metropolis.</p>

<p>Let the same system of moderate rewards also be extended to
beadles,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> for useful Public service <i>actually performed</i>, as is
proposed with regard to officers of justice, watchmen, and patroles;
and much good will arise to the community, without any great
additional expence.</p>

<p>It is in vain to expect that the Public can be well served, unless the
emolument becomes an object to good and able men; but these
extraordinary rewards (as has already been observed) should always
depend upon the vigilance and exertion of the parties themselves, in
detecting offenders of every description: and should be paid, on its
appearing to the Magistrate, that no <i>impropriety</i> or <i>indiscretion</i>
has marked their conduct. If, on the contrary, they should be proved
to have acted oppressively or improperly, a power of immediate
dismission and punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">-416-</a></span> should, in all instances, be lodged in
Justices of the Peace, to be exercised according to the nature of the
offence.</p>

<p>Having thus stated the civil force of the Metropolis, in
peace-officers, watchmen and patroles, making an aggregate of 3084
men&mdash;it may be necessary and useful to give such information relative
to the Magistracy, as may tend to shew the present state of the
Police, and to illustrate what remains to be further suggested on the
subject of its improvement; for the preservation of the Public peace,
and the <i>detection</i> and <i>apprehension</i> of every class of offenders.</p>

<hr class="med" />

<p>There exist at present no less than <i>five</i> separate jurisdictions
within the limits of the Metropolis&mdash;namely,&mdash;</p>

<p>The jurisdiction of the Magistrates presiding at the seven Public
Offices, not only extends to Westminster and Middlesex; (and, in most
instances, lately, to the liberty of the Tower:) but also to the
counties of Surry, Kent, and Essex, from which considerable advantages
in the prompt detection and ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">-419-</a></span>prehension of offenders have accrued to
the Public: The only difficulty that now remains to be removed, with
respect to the clashing of jurisdictions, is that which regards the
city of London; where, from its contiguity, and immediate and close
connection with every other part of the Metropolis, considerable
inconveniences and injuries to the public are felt, not only from the
circumstance of the jurisdiction of the City Magistrates not being
extended over the <i>whole</i> of the Metropolis, as well as the four
adjoining counties; but also from the Police Magistrates having no
authority quickly to follow up informations, by issuing warrants to
search for property, and to apprehend persons charged with offences in
the City. The whole difficulty resolves itself into a mere matter of
<i>punctilio</i>, founded perhaps on ill-grounded jealousy, or
misapprehension, which a little explanation would probably remove.</p>

<p>Where the object is to do good;&mdash;and where not even the shadow of harm
can arise, no limits should be set to local jurisdictions; especially
where privileges are proposed to be given; (as in this case, to the
city of London;)&mdash;and where none are to be taken away.</p>

<p>For the purpose of establishing a complete and well-connected System
of <i>detection</i>, some means ought certainly to be adopted, more closely
to unite the City and Police Magistrates,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> that they may, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">-420-</a></span>
greater degree, go hand in hand in all matters regarding the general
interest of the Metropolis and its environs; making the suppression of
crimes one common cause, and permitting no punctilio, regarding
jurisdiction, to prevent the operation of their united energy in the
prompt detection of offenders; This, from the extended state of
Commerce and Society, and the great increase of property, is now
rendered a measure in which the inhabitants of the whole Metropolis,
as well as the adjacent villages, have a common interest. It is an
evil, which affects all ranks, and calls aloud for the speedy adoption
of some effectual remedy.</p>

<hr class="dbl1" />
<hr class="dbl2" />

<p><span class="cap">A</span>RRIVING at that <i>point</i> in the progress of this Work, where persons
accused of offences are detected and brought before Magistrates for
examination, ultimately to be committed for trial, if the evidence
shall be sufficient:&mdash;It is proper to explain the prevailing practice
under such circumstances.</p>

<p>The task, in this case imposed upon the Magistrate, is arduous and
important; requiring not only great purity of conduct, a profound
knowledge of mankind, and of the common affairs of life; but in a more
peculiar manner those powers of discrimination which may enable him to
discover how far criminality attaches to the party accused; and
whether there are grounds sufficient to abridge for a time, or
ultimately to deprive the prisoner of his liberty, until a Jury of his
country shall decide upon his fate.</p>

<p>It frequently happens that persons accused of crimes are apprehended
under circumstances where no doubt can rest on the mind of the
Magistrates as to the guilt of the prisoner; but where the legal
evidence is nevertheless insufficient to authorize an immediate
commitment for trial.</p>

<p>In these instances, (while he commits <i>pro tempore</i>,) he is called
upon in a particular manner to exert the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">-423-</a></span> whole powers of his mind, by
adopting such judicious measures as shall be the means of detecting
the offenders; by discovering the goods or property stolen, or by
admitting such evidence for the Crown as may, with other corroborating
testimony, prevent the ends of justice from being defeated.</p>

<p>Where a Magistrate proceeds with indefatigable zeal and attention, and
at the same time exercises good judgment, he will seldom fail of
success; for in this case a similar spirit will animate the officers
under his controul, whose activity and industry are generally in
proportion to that manifested by their superiors.</p>

<p>Much as every active Magistrate must regret that deficiency of
pecuniary resource, which, under the present system, prevents him from
rewarding those who must occasionally be employed to detect notorious
offenders, this circumstance ought not to abate this zeal in any
respect; since by perseverance it generally happens, that every good
and proper arrangement for the immediate advantage of the Public, may
be ultimately obtained.</p>

<p>The Magistrate having done his duty by committing an offender for
trial, satisfied of his guilt and the sufficiency of the evidence to
convict him: and having also bound over the prosecutor and the
witnesses as the Law directs, to attend the Grand Jury, and (if a bill
be found) to prosecute and give evidence upon the indictment; it might
appear to the common observer, that the culprit's case becomes
hopeless and forlorn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">-424-</a></span></p>

<p>This, however, is by no means a stage in the progress that intimidates
a professed thief; he feels and knows that, although guilty of the
crime laid to his charge, he has many chances of escaping; and these
chances unquestionably operate as encouragements to the commission of
crimes.</p>

<p>His first hope is, that he shall intimidate the Prosecutor and
Witnesses, by the threatenings of the gang with whom he is
connected;&mdash;his next that he may compound the matter; or bribe or
frighten material witnesses, so as to keep back evidence; or induce
them to speak doubtfully at the trial, though positive evidence was
given before the Magistrate; or if all should fail, recourse is had to
perjury, by bringing the Receiver, or some other associate, to swear
an <i>alibi</i>.</p>

<p>Various other considerations also operate in strengthening the hopes
of acquittal; partly arising from the vast numbers who are discharged
or acquitted at every Session of gaol-delivery; and partly from the
carelessness and inattention of Prosecutors, who are either unable or
unwilling to sustain the expence of Counsel to oppose the arguments
and objections which will be offered in behalf of the prisoner: or are
soured by loss of valuable time, experienced, perhaps in former
prosecutions;<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">-425-</a></span> ultimately from a dread entertained by timid
persons, who foolishly and weakly consider themselves as taking away
the life of a fellow-creature, merely because they prosecute or give
evidence; not reflecting that it is the <i>Law</i> only that can punish
offenders, and <i>not</i> the individual prosecutor or witnesses.</p>

<p>False Humanity, exercised in this manner, is always cruelty to the
public, and not seldom to the prisoners themselves.&mdash;All depredations
upon property are <i>public wrongs</i>, in the suppression and punishment
of which it is the duty of every good man to lend his assistance; a
duty more particularly incumbent upon those who are the immediate
sufferers: through their means only can Public Justice operate in
punishing those miscreants, by whom the innocent are <i>put in fear,
alarmed and threatened with horrid imprecations&mdash;with loss of life by
means of loaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">-426-</a></span> pistols</i>; or bodily injury, from being hacked with
cutlasses, or beaten with bludgeons&mdash;under circumstances where neither
age nor sex is spared.&mdash;</p>

<p>Yet experience has shewn that these arguments, powerful as they are,
are insufficient to awaken in the mind of men that species of Public
spirit which shall induce sufferers in general, by robberies of
different kinds, to become willing prosecutors, under the various
trying delays of Courts of Justice; and frequently with the trouble of
bringing a number of witnesses from the country, who are kept in
attendance on the court perhaps several days together, at a very
considerable expence.</p>

<p>Such a burden imposed upon the subject, in addition to the losses
already sustained, in a case too where the offence is of a public
nature, is certainly not easily reconcileable with that spirit of
justice, and attention to the rights of individuals, which forms so
strong a general feature in the Jurisprudence of the Country.</p>

<p>From all these circumstances it happens that innumerable felonies are
concealed, and the loss is suffered in silence as the least of two
evils; by which means thieves are allowed to reign with impunity,
undisturbed, and encouraged to persevere in their evil practices.</p>

<p>Nothing, it is to be feared, can cure this evil, and establish a
general system of protection, but a vigorous Police; strengthened and
improved by the appointment of Deputy-Prosecutors for the Crown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">-427-</a></span>
acting under the Attorney-General for the time being. An establishment
of this sort, even at a very small salary, would be considered as an
honourable <i>entré</i> to many young Counsel; who, in protecting the
Public against the frauds, tricks, and devices of old and professed
thieves, by which at present they escape punishment, might keep the
stream of justice pure, and yet allow no advantage to be taken of the
prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>As it must be admitted on all hands, that it is the interest of the
Public that no guilty offender should escape punishment;&mdash;it seems to
be a position equally clear and incontrovertible, that wherever, from
a defect in the system of prosecutions, or any other cause, a prisoner
escapes the punishment due to his crimes, substantial justice is
wounded, and public wrongs are increased.</p>

<p>It has been already stated in the <a href="#CHAP_XIV">preceding Chapter</a>, that there are
five separate Jurisdictions in the Metropolis, where Magistrates
exercise limited authority.&mdash;Of course, there are five inferior Courts
of Justice, where lesser offences, committed in London and its
vicinity, are tried by Justices of the Peace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">-428-</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. The general and Quarter Sessions of the Peace; held eight
times a year, by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, at
Guildhall&mdash;<i>for the trial of small Offences committed in
London</i>.</p>

<p>2. The Quarter Sessions of the Peace; held four times a year
at Guildhall, Westminster, by the Justices acting for that
City and Liberty&mdash;<i>for the trial of small Offences committed
in Westminster only</i>.</p>

<p>3. The General and Quarter Sessions of the Peace; held eight
times a year, at the New Sessions House on
Clerkenwell-Green, (commonly called Hicks's Hall) by the
Justices only of the County of Middlesex&mdash;<i>for the trial of
small Offences committed in Middlesex and Westminster</i>.</p>

<p>4. The General Quarter Sessions of the Peace; held in the
Sessions-House in Well-Close-Square, by the Justices for the
Liberty of the Tower of London&mdash;<i>for the trial of small
Offences committed within the Royalty</i>.</p>

<p>5. The Quarter Sessions of the Peace; held by the Justices
for the County of Surry, at the New Sessions House at
Newington, Surry, in January;&mdash;At Reigate, in April;&mdash;At
Guildhall, in July;&mdash;and Kingston-upon-Thames, in October,
each year;&mdash;<i>where small Offences committed in Southwark and
the Neighbourhood are tried</i>.</p></div>

<p>These five inferior Courts of Justice take cognizance of <i>Petty
Larcenies, Frauds, Assaults, Misdemeanors, and other offences
punishable by fine, imprisonment, whipping, and the pillory</i>:&mdash;and in
certain cases, the power of the Justices extends to transportation.</p>

<p>The higher and more atrocious offences committed in London and
Middlesex, are tried at the Justice-Hall, in the Old Bailey; by a
special com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">-429-</a></span>mission of Oyer and Terminer to the Lord Mayor, and a
certain number of the Judges, with the Recorder and Common Serjeant of
the City of London.</p>

<p>Offences of this latter degree of atrocity, perpetrated in that part
of the Metropolis which is situated in the Borough of Southwark and
County of Surry, are tried at the assizes, held twice a year at
<i>Kingston-upon-Thames</i>, <i>Croydon</i>, or <i>Guildford</i>.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Thus it appears, that five inferior and two superior Tribunals of
Justice are established for trying the different crimes committed in
the Metropolis.</p>

<p>As it may be useful, for the purpose of elucidating the suggestions
already offered upon this branch of the subject, that a connected view
of the result of these <i>Trials</i> should make a part of this Work;&mdash;the
following <a href="#SUMMARY">Abstract</a>, (including the discharges of Prisoners by
Magistrates) has been made up for this immediate purpose: from
authentic documents obtained from the keepers of the eight different
prisons and houses of correction in the city of London, and in the
counties of Middlesex and Surry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">-430-</a></span></p>

<p>It applies to the period, from September, 1794, till September, 1795,
which is chosen as a sort of medium between Peace and War.</p>

<p>It is impossible to contemplate this collected aggregate of the
prisoners annually discharged upon the Public, without feeling a
strong anxiety to remedy an evil rendered extremely alarming, from the
number which composes the dismal catalogue of Human Depravity.</p>

<p>Every inquiry in the progress of this Work proves a radical defect
somewhere.</p>

<p>While the public tribunals are filled with Judges, the purity of whose
conduct adds lustre to their own and the national character, why
should not every subordinate part of the Criminal Jurisprudence of the
Country be so organized, as to co-operate, in the greatest possible
degree, with the efforts of those higher orders of the Magistracy in
accomplishing the purposes of substantial justice?</p>

<p>Nothing could tend more to promote this object, than the appointment
already proposed of a Public Prosecutor for the Crown.</p>

<p>An institution of this kind would terrify the hordes of miscreants now
at open war with the peaceable and useful part of the Community, in a
greater degree than any one measure that could possibly be adopted.</p>

<p>It would be the means of destroying those hopes and chances which
encourage criminal people to persevere in their depredations upon the
Public.</p>

<p>It would not only remove that aversion which Prosecutors manifest on
many occasions, to come forward, for the purpose of promoting the ends
of public justice; but it would prevent, in a great measure, the
possibility of compounding felonies, or of suborning witnesses.<a name="FNanchor_125_127" id="FNanchor_125_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_127" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>It would also be the means of counteracting the various tricks and
devices of old thieves; and occasion an equal measure of Justice to be
dealt out to them, as to the novices in crimes:&mdash;It would do more,&mdash;It
would protect real innocence,&mdash;for in such cases the Public Prosecutor
would never fail to act as the friend of the prisoner.</p>

<p>The prevailing practice in criminal trials, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">-432-</a></span> true spirit of
mildness and humanity, induces the Judge to act in some degree as
counsel for the prisoner.&mdash;Without a Prosecutor for the Crown,
therefore, every trifling inaccuracy in the indictment is allowed to
become a fatal obstacle to conviction;<a name="FNanchor_126_128" id="FNanchor_126_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_128" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> circumstances which would
frequently throw great light upon the charges, are not brought under
the review of the jury, and thus public justice is defeated.</p>

<p>Upon an average, the Magistrates of the Metropolis commit annually,
(out of many times that number who are equally objects of punishment,)
from about 2500 to 3000 persons, male and female, for trial, at the
seven different Courts of Justice in and near the Metropolis; charged
with a variety of felonies, misdemeanors, and other petty offences.
But after fully convincing their own minds, from a careful, and in
many instances, a most laborious investigation, that the parties are
guilty, they are obliged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">-433-</a></span> from experience, to prepare themselves for
the mortification of seeing their labour and exertions in a great
measure lost to the Community: the major part of these criminals being
returned upon Society, without any effectual steps adopted for their
reformation, or any means used for the prevention of a repetition of
their crimes. A considerable proportion of this wretched number may
have suffered perhaps a slight punishment for their demerits; but
which produces no effect that is not ultimately mischievous to the
Community; since it serves merely to initiate them, in a greater
degree, in the knowledge and means of committing new acts of fraud and
villainy.</p>

<p>To establish a System calculated to prevent criminals from returning
to their evil practices after punishment is the very essence of good
Police; but notwithstanding its importance to the Community, no
measures have ever yet been adopted, calculated to attain so desirable
an object.&mdash;It is however ardently to be hoped, that the period is
fast approaching, when this great desideratum will be in a certain
degree obtained; and that the suggestions offered in the subsequent
Chapters, may tend to accelerate the renovation of this forlorn and
miserable class of outcasts, by means of an appropriate <i>Penitentiary
System</i>.</p>

<p><span class="cap">I</span>MPERFECT in many respects as the criminal Law appears, from what has
been detailed and stated in the preceding Chapters, and much as the
great increase of capital offences, created during the last and
present Century, is to be lamented:&mdash;it cannot be denied that several
changes have taken place in the progress of Society, favourable to the
cause of humanity, and more consonant to reason and justice, in the
appropriation and the mode of inflicting punishments.</p>

<p>The Benefit of Clergy, which for a long period exempted clerical
people only, from the punishment of death in cases of felony, was by
several statutes<a name="FNanchor_127_131" id="FNanchor_127_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_131" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> extended to <i>peers</i>, <i>women</i>, and all persons
<i>able to read</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">-436-</a></span> who, pleading their Clergy, suffered only a corporal
punishment, or a year's imprisonment; and those men who <i>could not
read</i>, if under the degree of peerage, were hanged.<a name="FNanchor_128_132" id="FNanchor_128_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_132" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>This unaccountable distinction was actually not removed until the 5th
of Queen Anne, cap. 6, which extended the benefit of clergy to all who
were intitled to ask it, <i>whether they could read or not</i>.<a name="FNanchor_129_133" id="FNanchor_129_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_133" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>In the course of the present century, several of the old sanguinary
modes of punishment have been either, very properly, abolished by acts
of parliament, or allowed, to the honour of humanity, to fall into
disuse:&mdash;such as <i>burning alive (particularly women) cutting off hands
or ears, slitting nostrils, or branding in the hand or face</i>; and
among lesser punishments, fallen into disuse, may be mentioned <i>the
ducking-stool</i>.</p>

<p>The punishment of death for felony (as has already been observed) has
existed since the reign of Henry I. nearly 700 years.&mdash;Transportation
is commonly understood to have been first introduced, anno 1718, by
the act of the 4th George I. cap. 11; and afterwards enlarged by the
Act 6th of George I. c. 23, which allowed the court a discretionary
power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">-437-</a></span> order felons who were by law entitled to their clergy, to be
transported to the American plantations for seven or fourteen years,
according to circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_130_134" id="FNanchor_130_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_134" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Since that period the mode of punishment has undergone several other
alterations; and many Crimes which were formerly considered of an
inferior rank, have been rendered capital: which will be best
elucidated by the following Catalogue of Offences, divided into six
classes according to the Laws now in force.</p>

Larceny, and every species of misdemeanor and vagrancy, are generally
tried, (with some few exceptions) by the Justices in their General and
Quarter Sessions, where, in certain cases in Middlesex, they act under
a commission of Oyer and Terminer. The Magistrates in Petty Sessions,
and in several instances a <i>single Magistrate</i>, have also the power of
convicting in a summary way, for a variety of small misdemeanors, and
acts of vagrancy: and of punishing the delinquents with fine and
imprisonment.</p>

<p>Thus it appears, that in London only, of 1060 prisoners, tried in the
course of a year, only 493 were punished; of whom 197, after a
temporary confinement, would return upon the Public, with little
prospect of being better disposed to be useful to Society, than
before.&mdash;It may be estimated that in all England, including those
offenders who are tried at the County Sessions, upwards of five
thousand individuals, charged with criminal offences, are thrown back
upon Society every year.&mdash;</p>

<p>But this is not all,&mdash;for according to the present System, out of
about <i>two hundred</i> and upwards who are, upon an average every year,
doomed to suffer the punishment of death, <i>four-fifths</i> or more are
generally pardoned<a name="FNanchor_135_140" id="FNanchor_135_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_140" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> either on condition of being transported, or
of going into His Majesty's service, and not seldom without any
condition at all.</p>

<p>Hence it is, that, calculating on all the different chances,
encouragements to commit crimes actually arise out of the System
intended for their prevention:&mdash;<i>first, from the hope of avoiding
detection and apprehension;&mdash;secondly, of escaping conviction, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">-450-</a></span>
the means used to vitiate and suborn the evidence;&mdash;thirdly, from the
mercy of the Jury, in considering the punishment too severe;&mdash;and
fourthly, from the interest of persons of rank or consideration,
applying (under circumstances where humanity becomes the friend of
every person doomed to die), for the interference of Royal Mercy, by
Pardons</i>.</p>

<p>God forbid that the Author of these pages should do so much violence
to his own feelings, as to convey an idea hostile to the extension of
that amiable Prerogative vested in the Sovereign; and which His
Majesty has exercised with a benevolent regard to the feelings of
Humanity, and a merciful disposition truly characteristic of the mind
of a great and good King.</p>

<p>These animadversions are by no means pointed against the exercise of a
privilege so benign, and even so necessary, in the present state of
the Criminal Law;&mdash;they regard only the impositions which have been
practised upon so many well-intentioned, respectable, and amiable
Characters, who have, from motives of humanity, interested themselves
in obtaining <i>free pardons for Convicts</i>, or <i>pardons on condition of
going into the Army or Navy</i>.</p>

<p>If these humane individuals, who exert themselves in applications of
this sort, were to be made acquainted with one half of the gross
impositions practised upon their credulity, or the evil consequences
arising to Society from such pardons, (particularly unconditional
pardons) they would shudder at the extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">-451-</a></span> of the cruelty exercised
towards the Public, and even, in many instances, to the Convicts
themselves, by this false humanity.</p>

<p>In a Country, where, from the great caution which mingles in that part
of the Criminal Jurisprudence which relates to the trial of
Offenders,&mdash;it is scarcely possible that an honest or an innocent
person can be convicted of a capital offence.<a name="FNanchor_136_141" id="FNanchor_136_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_141" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>&mdash;It would seem to
be a good criterion, that the Royal Mercy should only be extended on
two indispensable conditions.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. <i>That the Convict under sentence of death should, for the
sake of Public Justice, (and to deter others from the
commission of crimes) discover all his accomplices, and the
robberies, or other crimes he has committed.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>That he should be transported; or make retribution to
the parties he has injured by being kept at hard labour for
life; or until ample security shall be given for good
behaviour after such retribution is made.</i></p></div>

<p>The precaution not having been used of knowing <i>for certain</i>, before
pardons were granted, whether the parties were fit for His Majesty's
service or not; the Convicts themselves carefully concealing every
kind of bodily infirmity;&mdash;and the pardons containing no eventual
condition of ultimate Transportation, in case the persons should be
found unfit for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">-452-</a></span> Army or Navy;&mdash;the result has been, that many
Convicts, who have been since actually Thieves upon the Town, were
almost instantly thrown back upon the Public.&mdash;Some, even before they
were attested by the Magistrate, in consequence of the discovery of
bodily incapacity; and others, in a very short time after they had
gone into His Majesty's Service, from the like unfitness being
discovered; from some artful device practised to procure a
discharge&mdash;or from desertion.&mdash;A professed Thief is never deficient in
that species of artifice and resource which is necessary to rid him of
any incumbrance.</p>

<p>This, however, is seldom taken into the calculation when Humanity
urges philanthropic Characters to interest themselves in behalf of
Criminals; nor could it perhaps otherwise have been known, or
believed, that so many of these outcasts of Society have found means
again to mingle with the mass of the people.</p>

<p>What impression must these facts make on the intelligent mind!&mdash;will
they not warrant the following conclusion?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. That every individual, restored to Society in this way,
is the means of affording a species of encouragement,
peculiarly calculated to bring others into the same dreadful
situation, from which the unhappy Convict is thus rescued.</p>

<p>2. That for this reason every pardon granted, without some
lesser punishment, or removing the convicts from Society, is
a link broken in the chain of justice, by annihilating that
united strength which binds the whole together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">-453-</a></span></p>

<p>3. That by removing the terror of punishments by frequent
pardons, the design of the Law is rendered in a great
measure ineffectual; the lives of persons <i>executed</i> are
thrown away, being sacrificed rather to the vengeance of the
Law than to the good of the Public; and no other advantage
is received than by getting rid of one thief, whose place,
(under present circumstances,) will speedily be supplied by
another.<a name="FNanchor_137_142" id="FNanchor_137_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_142" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p></div>

<p>Nothing can sanction the punishment of death for crimes short of
murder, <i>but the terror of the example operating as the means of
prevention</i>.&mdash;It is upon this principle alone that one man is
sacrificed to the preservation of thousands.&mdash;Executions, therefore,
being exhibited as seldom as a regard to the public interest really
required, ought to be rendered as <i>terrific</i> and <i>solemn</i> to the eyes
of the people as possible.</p>

<p>The punishment now in use, considered in point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">-454-</a></span> of law to be next to
that of deprivation of life, is <i>Transportation</i>.</p>

<p>It has been already mentioned that Parliament authorized this species
of punishment in the year 1718&mdash;when the general plan of sending
Convicts to the American Plantations was first adopted. This System
continued for 56 years; during which period, and until the
commencement of the American War in 1775, great numbers of Felons were
sent chiefly to the Province of Maryland. The rigid discipline which
the colonial Laws authorized the masters<a name="FNanchor_138_143" id="FNanchor_138_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_143" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> to exercise over
servants, joined to the prospects which agricultural pursuits, after
some experience was acquired, afforded to these <i>Outcasts</i>, tended to
reform the chief part; and after the expiration of their servitude,
they mingled in the Society of the Country, under circumstances highly
beneficial to themselves and even to the Colony. Possessed in general
(as every adroit thief must be) of good natural abilities, they
availed themselves of the habits of industry they acquired in the
years of their servitude&mdash;became farmers and planters on their own
account; and many of them, succeeding in these pursuits, not only
acquired that degree of respectability which is attached to property
and industry; but also in their turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">-455-</a></span> became masters, and purchased
the servitude of future Transports sent out for sale.<a name="FNanchor_139_144" id="FNanchor_139_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_144" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>The Convicts having accumulated greatly in the year 1776, and the
intercourse with America being shut up, it became indispensably
necessary to resort to some other expedient; and in the choice of
difficulties the System of the <i>Hulks</i> was suggested, and first
adopted under the authority of an Act of the 16th of his present
Majesty.</p>

<p>The Legislature, uncertain with regard to the success of this new
species of punishment, and wishing to make other experiments, by an
Act of the same Session,<a name="FNanchor_140_145" id="FNanchor_140_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_145" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> empowered the Justices of every county
in England to prepare Houses of Correction for the reception of
Convicts under sentence of death, to whom his Majesty should extend
his Royal Mercy, to be kept at hard labour for a term not exceeding
ten years.</p>

<p>The same Act, among many other excellent regulations, ordered the
Convicts to be kept separate, and not allowed to mix with any
offenders convicted of crimes less than Larceny&mdash;and that they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">-456-</a></span>
be fed with coarse inferior food, water, and small beer, without
permission to have any other food, drink, or cloathing, than that
allowed by the Act, under certain penalties:&mdash;they were to be clothed
at the public expence.</p>

<p>And as an encouragement to these delinquents, while such as refused to
work were to receive corporal punishment, those who behaved well had
not only the prospect held out of shortening the period of their
confinement, but also were to receive decent clothes, and a sum of
money not less than <i>forty shillings</i>, nor more than <i>five pounds</i>,
when discharged.</p>

<p>This well-intentioned Act<a name="FNanchor_141_146" id="FNanchor_141_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_146" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> (which certainly admits of many
improvements), was followed up, three years afterwards, by another
Statute, (19 Geo. III.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">-457-</a></span> cap. 74,) which had two very important objects
in view.</p>

<p>The first was to erect, in some convenient common or waste ground, in
either of the counties of <i>Middlesex</i>, <i>Essex</i>, <i>Kent</i>, or <i>Surry</i>,
<i>Two large Penitentiary Houses</i>, the one to hold 600 <i>male</i>, and the
other 300 <i>female Convicts</i>, with proper <i>storehouses</i>, <i>workhouses</i>,
and <i>lodging-rooms</i>; an <i>infirmary</i>, <i>chapel</i>, and <i>burying-ground</i>; a
<i>prison</i>, <i>kitchen</i>, <i>garden</i>, and <i>air-grounds</i>: with proper
<i>offices</i>, and other <i>necessary apartments</i>.</p>

<p>The expence of these grounds and erections was to be paid out of the
treasury; and his Majesty was empowered to appoint three persons as a
Committee of Management for regulating the Establishment; under the
controul of the Justices of the Peace of the County, and Judges of
Assize, with power to appoint a <i>clerk</i>, <i>governor</i>, <i>chaplain</i>,
<i>surgeon</i>, or <i>apothecary</i>, <i>store-keepers</i>, and <i>task-masters</i>; and
also a <i>matron</i> for the females;&mdash;and to allow salaries to each, which
were to be paid out of the profits of the work, to be performed by the
Convicts.</p>

<p>As soon as the buildings should be completed, the Court, before whom
any person was convicted for a transportable offence, might, in lieu
thereof, order the prisoner to be punished by confinement, in any of
these Penitentiary Houses, there to be kept to hard labour in the
proportion of 5 <i>years</i> instead of 7 <i>years' transportation</i>, and not
exceeding 7 years in lieu of 14 <i>years' transportation</i>; limiting at
the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">-458-</a></span> time the number of Convicts to be sent annually from the
Circuits in the Country, and from the different Sessions in the
Metropolis.</p>

<p>This Act lays down various specific rules for the government of the
Establishment, and for the employment of the Prisoners; and the
following works, as being of the most servile kind and least liable to
be spoiled by ignorance, neglect, or obstinacy, are selected, namely&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Treading in a wheel for moving machinery.</li>
<li>2. Drawing in a capstan, for turning a mill or engine.</li>
<li>3. Sawing stone</li>
<li>4. Polishing marble</li>
<li>5. Beating hemp</li>
<li>6. Rasping logwood</li>
<li>7. Chopping rags</li>
<li>8. Making cordage</li>
<li>9. Picking oakum</li>
<li>10. Weaving sacks</li>
<li>11. Knitting nets, &amp;c. &amp;c.</li>
</ul>


<p>The food of the different offenders, as in the former Act, was limited
to bread and any coarse meat, with water and small beer; and the
Prisoners were to be cloathed in uniform apparel, with badges affixed,
agreeable to the Institution.</p>

<p>Certain other rules were established for the discipline of the house,
under the direction of the Committee to be appointed by his Majesty;
who were to attend every fortnight, and to have power to reward such
offenders as should appear most diligent and meritorious, by giving
them a part of their earnings, to be applied for the use of themselves
end families.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">-459-</a></span></p>

<p>And when an offender should be discharged, decent clothing was to be
delivered to him; with a sum of money for present subsistence, not
less than <i>twenty shillings</i>, nor more than <i>three pounds</i>.</p>

<p>The second purpose of this Act (and which is the only part of it which
was ever carried into effect), regards <i>the continuation of the System
of the Hulks</i>.</p>

<p>It declares that for the more effectual punishment of atrocious male
offenders liable to be transported, the Court may order such Convicts
as are of proper age, and free from bodily infirmity, to be punished
by being kept on board ships or vessels; and employed in hard labour
in raising sand, soil, and gravel, and cleansing the River Thames, or
any other river, or port, approved by the Privy Council; or in any
other works upon the banks or shores of the same, under the direction
of superintendants approved of by the Justices, for a term not less
than <i>one</i> year, nor more than <i>five</i>; except an offender be liable to
transportation for 14 years, in which case his punishment may be
commuted for 7 years on board the Hulks.</p>

<p>The mode of feeding is the same as already explained, and the clothing
is to be at the discretion of the superintendant. A similar
discipline, varied only by local circumstances, is also established;
and on the discharge of any of the convicts, they are to receive for
present subsistence from 20<i>s.</i> to 3<i>l.</i> according to circumstances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">-460-</a></span></p>

<p>The concluding part of the Act obliges the governors and
superintendants of the two Establishments to make annual returns to
the Court of King's Bench: and also authorizes his Majesty <i>to appoint
an Inspector of the two Penitentiary Houses, of the several vessels or
hulks on the River Thames, and of all the other gaols and places of
criminal confinement within the City of London and County of
Middlesex</i>; these Inspectors are personally to visit every such place
of confinement at least once a quarter, to examine into the
particulars of each, and to make a return to the Court of King's
Bench, of the <i>state of the buildings&mdash;the conduct of the
officers&mdash;treatment of the prisoners&mdash;state of their earnings and
expences</i>&mdash;and to follow up this by a report to both Houses of
Parliament, at the beginning of each Session.</p>

<p>It is much to be lamented that neither of these two salutary Acts, so
far as regarded <i>National Penitentiary Houses</i>, which seemed to hold
out so fair a prospect of employing convicts, in pursuits connected
with <i>productive labour</i>, <i>industry</i>, and ultimate <i>reformation</i>,
without sending them out of the kingdom, have been carried into
execution. In the year 1784, the System of Transportation was again
revived, by the Act of the 24th Geo. III. Stat. 2. cap. 56; "which
empowers the Court, before whom a male Felon shall be convicted, to
order the prisoner to be transported beyond seas, either within his
Majesty's dominions or elsewhere; and his service to be assigned to
the contractor who shall undertake such transportation."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">-461-</a></span></p>

<p>The same Act continues the System of the Hulks for a further length of
time; by directing the removal of Convicts, under sentence of death,
and reprieved by his Majesty, and also such as are under sentence of
Transportation (being free from infectious disorders) to other places
of confinement, either inland, or on board of any ship or vessel in
the river Thames, or any other navigable river; and to continue them
so confined until transported according to law, or until the
expiration of the term of the sentence should otherwise entitle them
to their liberty.</p>

<p>This plan of Transportation, through the medium of contractors,
although some Felons were sent to Africa,<a name="FNanchor_142_147" id="FNanchor_142_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_147" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> does not appear to have
answered; from the great difficulty of finding any situation, since
the Revolution in America, where the service of Convicts could be
rendered productive or profitable to Merchants, who would undertake to
transport them; and hence arose the idea of making an Establishment
for these outcasts of Society in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">-462-</a></span> the infant colony of New South
Wales, to which remote region it was at length determined to transport
atrocious offenders.&mdash;Accordingly, in the year 1787, an Act passed,
(27 Geo. III. cap. 2,) authorizing the establishment of a Court of
Judicature for the trial of offenders who should be transported to New
South Wales.</p>

<p>Another Act of the following year, (28 Geo. III. cap. 24,) empowered
his Majesty, under his Royal Sign Manual, to authorize any person to
make contracts for the Transportation of offenders, and to direct to
whom security should be given for the due performance of the contract.</p>

<p>By the Act of 30 George III. cap. 47, the Governor of the Settlement
may remit the punishment of offenders there: and on a certificate from
him their names shall be inserted in the next General Pardon.</p>

<p>Under these various legislative regulations, the two Systems of
Punishment, namely, the <i>Hulks</i> and <i>Transportation</i> to New South
Wales, have been authorized and carried into execution.</p>

<p>The System of the Hulks commenced on the 12th day of July, in the year
1776; and from that time until the 12th of December 1795,
comprehending a period of nineteen years, 7999 Convicts were ordered
to be punished by hard labour on the river Thames, and Langston and
Portsmouth harbours, which are accounted for in the following manner:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">-463-</a></span></p>

<p>By a subsequent account laid before the Select Committee of the House

Report, dated the 26th of June, 1798, it appears that the number of

<p>The Contractors for the Convicts at Woolwich and Langston Harbour, (as
appear from documents laid before the House of Commons) entered into
an agreement with the Lords of the Treasury obliging themselves for
<i>the consideration of 1s. 3d. per day</i>, (being 22<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>
a year <i>for each Convict</i>,) to provide at their own cost or charge,
<i>one</i> or more <i>Hulks</i>, to keep the same in proper repair, to provide
proper Ship's Companies for the safe Custody of such Convicts; and
sufficient <i>meat</i>, <i>drink</i>, <i>clothing</i> and <i>medical assistance</i>, for
the Convicts; as also to sustain all other charges (excepting the
expence of the <i>Chaplain</i>, <i>Coroner</i>, and bounties to discharged
Convicts;<a name="FNanchor_145_151" id="FNanchor_145_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_151" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>) obeying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">-467-</a></span> at the same time, all the orders of his
Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department,
respecting the Convicts. A subsequent contract was made at 14&frac12;<i>d.</i>
which reduced the expence to 22<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 0&frac12;<i>d.</i> per man: and which
is the allowance made to the present Contractors.</p>

<p>The terms of these contracts appear to be as favourable for Government
as could reasonably be expected, under all circumstances; and it would
appear, that some advantages are reaped by the Public, as the
documents laid before the House of Commons in 1792 and 1798, shew that
the labour performed by the Convicts is productive in a certain

<p>Upon this last statement the Select Committee on Finance (whose
various elaborate Reports on the State of the Nation, do them immortal
honour as Patriots and Legislators) very justly observe, that it is
extremely difficult to calculate the value of labour, performed under
such circumstances, with any degree of accuracy; and after several
views of the subject a conclusion is drawn, that the net expence to
the Public, for the maintenance of 1402 convicts in 1797, after
deducting the estimated value of labour, amounted to 20,878<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i>
10&frac12;<i>d.</i> being at the rate of 14<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 9&frac12;<i>d.</i> per man.</p>

<p>It appears, however, that out of the whole number of 1402 maintained
in 1797, only 1030 were actually employed. The labour of the remaining
370 was, therefore, in a great measure, lost to the Community.</p>

<p>At any rate, the value of this species of labour must be precarious,
and the advantages resulting from it problematical.</p>

<p>Since the mere "possession of so many idle hands will sometimes be a
temptation to engage in works, which but for this inducement, would
not recommend themselves by their intrinsic utility."<a name="FNanchor_146_152" id="FNanchor_146_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_152" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>While it is admitted, that considerable improvements have been made
with regard to the reduction of the expence; that provision has also
been made for religious and moral instruction, by established
sa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">-470-</a></span>laries to chaplains;&mdash;and that the contractors have honourably
performed their part of the undertaking; it is much to be lamented,
that this experiment has not been attended with more beneficial
consequences to the Public; not only in rendering the labour of the
convicts productive in a greater degree, so as at least to be equal to
the expence; but also in amending the morals of these miserable
out-casts; so that on their return to Society, they might, in some
respect, atone for the errors of their former lives, by a course of
honest industry, useful to themselves and to their country. On the
contrary, experience has shewn, that although an expence exceeding
623,000<i>l.</i> has been incurred by Government in the course of 22 years,
most of them, instead of profitting by the punishment they have
suffered (forgetting they were under sentence of death, and undismayed
by the dangers they have escaped) immediately rush into the same
course of depredation and warfare upon the public: nay, so hardened
and determined in this respect have some of them been, as even to make
proposals to their old friends, the Receivers, previous to the period
of their discharge, to purchase their newly acquired plunder. It has
already been shewn, that those few also, who are less depraved, and
perhaps disposed to amend their conduct, can find no resource for
labour; and are thus, too frequently, compelled, by dire necessity, to
herd with their former associates in iniquity, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">-471-</a></span> much to be
feared, that the chief part of the multitudes, who have been
periodically discharged, have either suffered for new offences, or are
actually at present afflicting Society by reiterated
depredations.<a name="FNanchor_147_153" id="FNanchor_147_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_153" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>After maturely considering the enormous expence, and the total
inefficacy of the System of the Hulks, aided by the new lights which
have been thrown upon the subject by the important documents called
for by the Select Committee on Finance, it appears clear to
demonstration, that it would be for the interest of the Country to
abandon the present System; and the Author heartily joins in the
opinion expressed by those respectable members of the
Legislature,&mdash;"<i>That our principal places of Confinement, and modes of
Punishment, so far from the Conversion and Reformation of the
Criminal, tend to send him forth at the expiration of the period of
his imprisonment more confirmed in vice; and that the general tendency
of our &#339;conomical arrangements upon this subject, is ill calculated
to meet the accumulating burdens, which are the infallible result of
so much error in the System of Police</i>."</p>

<p>Having thus explained the nature and effect of the punishment
inflicted on convicts, through the medium of the Hulks, and also the
expence attending these establishments; it will be necessary in the
next place, to examine the authentic documents, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">-472-</a></span> relate to the
transportation of Felons to New South Wales.</p>

<p>From the Appendix, page 122, of the 28th Report of the Select
Committee on Finance, printed the 26th of June 1798, it appears that
the number of Convicts sent to New South Wales and Norfolk Island<a name="FNanchor_148_154" id="FNanchor_148_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_154" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>

<p>The diminution of Convicts from 5858 to 3809 is to be accounted for,
by a certain proportion leaving the Settlement after the expiration of
their time, and also by deaths,<a name="FNanchor_149_155" id="FNanchor_149_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_155" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> which in the natural course of

<p>In resorting to this mode of disposing of Convicts, which at the time
must be considered as a choice of difficulties, a very large sum of
money has been expended.&mdash;Certainly much more than could have been
foreseen at the commencement: Since it appears from the 28th Report of
the Select Committee on Finance, who certainly have bestowed infinite
pains in the investigation, that the total amount exceeds <i>One Million
Sterling</i>, as will be seen from the following Statement, extracted

<p>Thus it appears, that in executing the sentence of the Law on 5765
Convicts more than One Million Sterling has been expended, nearly
equal to 180<i>l.</i> for each Convict, exclusive of the expence incurred
by the Counties, and by Government in the maintenance at home; and
without taking into the account the very considerable charge, which
must have been borne by the private Prosecutors in bringing these
Offenders to Justice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">-475-</a></span></p>

<p>The Select Committee in their laborious investigation of the effects
of this System, very justly observe, "that the numbers of the Convicts
do not appear to have kept pace with the increase of the
expence."&mdash;They proceed to state (page 27 of the Report) "that after a
trial of twelve years, it seems not too early to inquire whether the
peculiar advantages likely to arise from this plan are such as may be
considered as compensating for its probable expence. The security held
out by the difficulty of return on the part of the convicts is the
only advantage that strikes the eye: but the nature of this advantage,
the amount of it, and the certainty of it, seem not altogether
undeserving of inquiry; nor whether a security of the same sort more
at command, and more to be depended on, might not be purchased on less
exceptionable terms. It may be also worthy of inquiry (add the
Committee) whether the advantages looked for, from this establishment
may not be dependent on its weakness? and whether as it grows less
disadvantageous in point of finance, it will not be apt to grow less
advantageous in the character of an instrument of Police? The more
thriving the Settlement the more frequented: The more frequented the
less difficulty of return.&mdash;The more thriving too the less terrible.
To persons in some circumstances;&mdash;to persons who otherwise would have
been disposed to emigrate, it may <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: lose">loose</span> its
terrors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">-476-</a></span> altogether, especially if by money or other means the
servitude be avoidable. This inconvenience had already become sensible
in the instance of the comparatively old planted Colonies. Many,
though innocent, went thither voluntarily, even at the price of
servitude, while others under the notion of punishment, were sent
thither for their crimes; so that while to some the emigration remains
a punishment, to others it may become an adventure; but a punishment
should be the same thing to all persons, and at all times."</p>

<p>Contingencies, the Committee remark, may diminish the utility of the
Establishment, or may increase the expence. "Bad seasons, and the
destruction of the vegetable part of the stock of food: Mortality
among the as yet scanty stock of cattle.<a name="FNanchor_150_156" id="FNanchor_150_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_156" class="fnanchor">[150]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">-477-</a></span> Mischief from the
natives,&mdash;from insurrection among the convicts, or from the enemy.</p>

<p>"Here, as at Sierra Leone, malice may produce an expedition of
devastation. The illusions to which the spirit of rapine is so much
exposed may give birth to an enterprize of depredation; apprehensions
of any such event entertained here would necessarily give birth to
preparations of defence. The apprehensions may be well or ill
grounded&mdash;the measures taken for defence successful or unsuccessful;
but the expence in the mean time is incurred. The distance is
unexampled, and all danger as well as all expence swells in proportion
to the distance: these topics appear to merit consideration.</p>

<p>"Another circumstance is, that the labour of the whole number of
persons sent to these colonies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">-478-</a></span> whether as Convicts or Settlers, <i>is
entirely lost to the Country</i>, nor can any return, to compensate such
a loss, be expected till that very distant day, when the improved
state of the Colony may, by possibility, begin to repay a part of the
advance, by the benefits of its trade.</p>

<p>"Supposing abundance established, and remaining for ever without
disturbance, it may be deserving of consideration, in what shape and
in what degree, and with what degree of assurance, Government, in
point of Finance, is likely to profit by the abundance: for the stock
of the individuals, which each individual will consume, lay up or
sell, is on his own account; is not the Stock of Government. The
saving to Government depends upon the probity and zeal, and
intelligence of the Bailiffs in Husbandry, acting without personal
interest in the concern at that immense distance."</p>

<p>After opinions so decided, the result of an inquiry, aided by
extensive information, and conducted by men of talents and judgment,
it would ill become the Author of this Work to offer (if he could
suggest,) additional arguments to prove the disadvantages which have
attended, and which are likely to attend the transportation of
Convicts to New South Wales. Although with regard to mere
<i>subsistence</i>, there may be a prospect (and it is yet a distant one),
of the Colony becoming independent of supplies from this Country; yet
with respect to most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">-479-</a></span> other articles its wants will experience no
diminution, and having once engaged in the project, humanity requires
that the Settlement should be supplied at the expence of the Nation.</p>

<p>When the measure of establishing this Colony was adopted, a hope was
probably entertained that while the great difficulty and expence of
the passage home, joined to the fertility of the soil and the
salubrity of the climate, might induce convicts to remain after the
expiration of the period specified in their sentence, so as not to
become offensive again to their native Country; the removal to an
unknown region, inhabited by Savages, and situated at such a remote
distance from Great Britain would exhibit this species of punishment
in so terrific a light as to operate powerfully in preventing crimes.</p>

<p>Experience, however, has shewn that this salutary effect has not been
produced, and that crimes are not to be diminished by the dread of
punishment in any shape. This great desideratum is only to be attained
by a well-regulated Police, calculated to destroy the sources from
whence evil propensities spring, and to remove the facilities by which
criminality is nourished and assisted.</p>

<p>Under the present circumstances, where the mind continues depraved,
and where the harvest is so prolific, it ceases to be a matter of
wonder that a considerable proportion of the convicts transported to
New South Wales, have found their way back to their native
Country;&mdash;and that not a few of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">-480-</a></span> have again afflicted Society by
renewing their depredations on the Public.&mdash;It is, indeed, lamentable
to reflect, that after the extreme labour which has been bestowed, and
the unparalleled expence which has been incurred, no effect whatsoever
favourable to the interest of the Community, or to the security of
innocence, has been produced. Looking back to the period when
Government was relieved of the expence of Convicts, almost of every
description under sentence of Transportation, and reflecting on the
enormous expence which has been incurred since the channel of
disposal, through the medium of the late American Colonies, has been
shut up; considering that within the short period of twenty-five years
no less a sum than 1,663,974<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_151_158" id="FNanchor_151_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_158" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> has been expended in
transporting and maintaining about 15,000 Convicts, which would have
cost nothing under the old System;&mdash;it cannot be sufficiently
lamented, that so liberal a provision had not been employed in
establishing Systems of Prevention. One fourth part of this enormous
sum expended in a proper establishment of Preventive Police, would
probably have rendered transportation and punishment in a
con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">-481-</a></span>siderable degree unnecessary, while the Country would have
benefitted by the industry of a large proportion of these outcasts,
who would then have been compelled to earn an honest livelihood by
their labour.</p>

<p>Deploring the mass of turpitude which has drawn from the resources of
the Country so enormous a portion of wealth, it is no little
consolation to be able to look forward to a measure recommended by the
Select Committee, and in the train of being adopted by Government,
which holds out so fair a prospect not only of gradually diminishing
this expence in future, but also of rendering the labour of Convicts
productive, and of securing the Public against the repetition of those
depredations which have been rather increased than prevented, by the
System of punishments which have been heretofore adopted.</p>

<p>The advantages in contemplation are to be attained by carrying into
effect a <i>proposal for a new and less expensive mode of employing and
reforming Convicts</i>, which has been offered to the consideration of
Government by <span class="smcap">Jeremy Bentham</span>, Esq. and which appears to have been
fully investigated by the Finance Committee, who state it (p. 20, of
Report 28,) "to be no small recommendation to the plan, that the
Contractor proposes to employ the prisoners on his own account,
receiving a proportionally smaller sum from the Public for their
maintenance.&mdash;That the great and important advantages which
distinguish that plan from any other which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">-482-</a></span> been hitherto
suggested, consist in the certain employment and industrious
livelihood which it insures to those whose terms of confinement are
expired. In the responsibility which the Contractor proposes to take
upon himself, for the future good behaviour of Criminals entrusted to
his care, even when they shall be no longer under his control: in the
publicity which is meant to be given to the whole conduct and effect
of the Establishment, <i>moral</i>, <i>medical</i>, and <i>&#339;conomical</i>, as well
by an annual report of the state and proceedings, as by the constant
facility of inspection, which will in an unusual manner be afforded by
the very form and construction of the building, upon which the prompt
and easy exercise of the superintending power of the Governor himself
principally depends."</p>

<p>These advantages appear to the Committee of more importance, when the
periods of the enlargement of the several Convicts now on board the
Hulks are taken into consideration. The pernicious effects produced
upon the unfortunate persons confined in these seminaries of vice; and
the circumstance of 1411 destined to be enlarged in the course of 7
years, to afflict the Society from which they have been separated&mdash;the
Committee consider as deserving of very serious consideration: and
they conclude their view of the subject by expressing, an uncommon
degree of solicitude, that no delay should take place in the execution
of the contract with Mr. Bentham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">-483-</a></span> "because it would deprive the Public
for a longer time of the benefits of a plan, which they cannot but
look to as likely to be productive of the most essential advantage,
both in point of &#339;conomy and Police."</p>

<p>The object in view is by the aid of ingenious machinery, to render the
labour of every class of Convicts so productive to the Contractor, as
to admit of their being maintained at 25 per cent. less than the
expence incurred on board the Hulks; while a rational prospect is held
out of reforming these Convicts and returning them upon Society, not
only with purer morals, but with the knowledge of some trade or
occupation by which they may afterwards earn their bread;&mdash;but this is
not all.&mdash;The proposer of this important design insures to the
Convicts, after the expiration of their time, the means of obtaining a
<i>livelihood</i>; by setting up a <i>Subsidiary Establishment</i>, into which
all who found themselves otherwise destitute of employment would be
admitted, and where they would be continued in the exercise of the
trades in which they were employed during their confinement.</p>

<p>It is, however, impossible to do justice to the merit of this
<i>Proposal</i>, without laying it wholly before the Public. It seems to
embrace every object calculated to remove the errors and difficulties
of the present System, while it promises in a short time to relieve
the Finances of the Country from the enormous and unparalleled expence
which is incurred by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">-484-</a></span> the Establishment of the Hulks, and by
Transportation to New South Wales.</p>

<h3><span class="gesperrt">PROPOSAL</span><br />
<br />
<span class="sm">FOR A NEW AND LESS EXPENSIVE MODE OF</span><br />
<br />
<i>EMPLOYING</i> <span class="sm">AND</span> <i>REFORMING CONVICTS</i>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The Author</span>, having turned his thoughts to the Penitentiary System from
its first origin, and having lately contrived a Building in which any
number of persons may be kept within the reach of being inspected
during every moment of their lives, and having made out, as he
flatters himself, to demonstration, that the only eligible mode of
managing an Establishment of such a nature, in a Building of such a
construction, would be by <i>Contract</i>, has been induced to make public
the following Proposal for Maintaining and Employing Convicts in
general, or such of them as would otherwise be confined on board the
Hulks, for 25 per cent. less than it costs Government to maintain them
there at present; deducting also the average value of the work at
present performed by them for the Public: upon the terms of his
receiving the produce of their labour, <i>taking on himself the whole
expence of the</i> BUILDING, <i>fitting up and stocking</i>,<a name="FNanchor_152_159" id="FNanchor_152_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_159" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> without any
advance to be made by Government for that purpose, requiring only that
the abatement and deduction above-mentioned shall be suspended for the
first year.</p>

<p>Upon the above-mentioned Terms, he would engage as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I. To furnish the Prisoners with a constant supply of
wholesome <i>Food</i>, not limited in quantity, but adequate to
each man's desires.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">-485-</a></span></p>

<p>II. To keep them <i>clad</i> in a state of tightness and
neatness, superior to what is usual even in the Improved
Prisons.</p>

<p>III. To keep them supplied with <i>separate Beds</i> and Bedding,
competent to their situations, and in a state of cleanliness
scarcely any where conjoined with liberty.</p>

<p>IV. To insure to them a sufficient supply of artificial
<i>warmth</i> and <i>light</i>, whenever the season renders it
necessary: and thereby save the necessity of taking them
prematurely from their work, at such seasons (as in other
places) as well as preserve them from suffering by the
inclemency of the weather.</p>

<p>V. To keep constantly from them, in conformity to the
practice so happily received, every kind of <i>strong</i> and
spirituous liquor; unless where ordered in the way of
medicine.</p>

<p>VI. To maintain them in a state of inviolable, though
mitigated seclusion, in <i>assorted</i> companies, without any of
those opportunities of promiscuous association, which in
other places, disturb, if not destroy, whatever good effect
can have been expected from occasional solitude.</p>

<p>VII. To give them an interest in their work, by allowing
them a share in the produce.</p>

<p>VIII. To convert the prison into a <i>school</i>, and, by an
extended application of the principle of <i>the Sunday
Schools</i>, to return its inhabitants into the world
instructed, at least as well as in ordinary schools, in the
most useful branches of vulgar learning, as well as in some
trade or occupation, whereby they may afterwards earn their
livelihood. Extraordinary culture of extraordinary talents
is not, in this point of view, worth mentioning: it would be
for his own advantage to give them every instruction by
which the value of their labour may be increased.</p>

<p>IX. To pay a penal sum for every <i>escape</i>, with or without
any default of his, irresistible violence from without
excepted; and this without employing <i>irons</i> on any
occasion, or in any shape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">-486-</a></span></p>

<p>X. To provide them with <i>spiritual</i> and <i>medical</i>
Assistants, constantly living in the midst of them, and
incessantly keeping them in view.</p>

<p>XI. To pay a sum of money for every one who <i>dies</i> under his
care, taking thereby upon him the insurance of their lives
for an ordinary premium: and that at a rate grounded on an
average of the number of deaths, not among imprisoned
Felons, but among persons of the same ages in a state of
liberty within the Bills of Mortality.</p>

<p>XII. To lay for them the foundation-stone of a <i>provision
for old age</i>, upon the plan of the <i>Annuity Societies</i>.</p>

<p>XIII. To insure to them a <i>livelihood</i>, at the expiration of
their terms, by setting up a <i>Subsidiary Establishment</i>,
into which all such as thought proper, should be admitted,
and in which they would be continued in the exercise of the
trades in which they were employed during their confinement,
without any further expence to Government.</p>

<p>XIV. To make himself personally responsible for the
reformatory efficacy of his management, and even make
amends, in most instances, for any accident of its failure,
by paying a sum of money for every Prisoner convicted of a
Felony after his discharge, at a rate, increasing according
to the number of years he had been under the Proposer's
care, viz. a sum not exceeding 10<i>l.</i> if the Prisoner had
been in the Penitentiary Panopticon <i>one</i> year: not
exceeding 15<i>l.</i> if <i>two</i> years; not exceeding 20<i>l.</i> if
<i>three</i> years; not exceeding 25<i>l.</i> if <i>four</i> years; not
exceeding 30<i>l.</i> if <i>five</i> years or upwards: such sum to be
paid immediately on conviction, and to be applied to the
indemnification of the persons injured by such subsequent
offence, and to be equal in amount to the value of the
injury, so long as it did not exceed the sums respectively
above specified.</p>

<p>XV. To present to the Court of King's Bench, on a certain
day of every Term, and afterwards print and publish, at his
own expence, a Report, exhibiting, in detail, the state,
not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">-487-</a></span> only moral and medical, but economical, of the
Establishment; showing the whole profits, if any, and in
what manner they arise; and then and there, as well as on
any other day, upon summons from the Court, to make answer
to all such questions as shall be put to him in relation
thereto, not only on the part of the Court or Officer of the
Crown, but, by leave of the Court, on the part of any person
whatsoever; questions, the answer to which might tend to
subject him to conviction, though it were for a capital
crime, not excepted: treading under foot a maxim, invented
by the guilty for the benefit of the guilty, and from which
none but the guilty ever derived any advantage.</p>

<p>XVI. By neatness and cleanliness, by diversity of
employment, by variety of contrivance, and above all, by
that peculiarity of construction, which, without any
unpleasant or hazardous vicinity, enables the whole
Establishment to be inspected at a view, from a commodious
and insulated room in the centre, the Prisoners remaining
unconscious of their being thus observed, it should be his
study to render it a spectacle such as persons of all
classes would, in the way of amusement, be curious to
partake of: and that, not only on Sundays, at the time of
Divine Service, but on ordinary days, at meal-times, or
times of work: providing thereby a <i>system of
superintendance, universal, unchargeable and uninterrupted</i>,
the most effectual and <i>indestructible</i> of all securities
against abuse.</p></div>

<p>Such are the methods that have occurred to him for accomplishing that
identification of "<i>interest with duty</i>," the effectuating of which,
in the person of the Governour, is declared to be one of the leading
objects of the Penitentiary Act.&mdash;[19 <span class="smcap">Geo.</span> III. ch. 74.]</p>

<p>The station of Gaoler is not in common account a very elevated one:
the addition of Contractor has not much tendency to raise it. He
little dreamt, when he first launched into the subject, that he was to
become a suitor, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">-488-</a></span> in vain, for such an office. But
inventions unpractised might be in want of the inventor: and a
situation, thus clipped of emoluments, while it was loaded with
obligations, might be in want of candidates. Penetrated, therefore,
with the importance of the end, he would not suffer himself to see any
thing unpleasant or discreditable in the means.</p>

<hr class="med" />

<h3><i>Outline of the Plan of Construction alluded to in the above
Proposal.</i></h3>

<p>The Building <i>circular</i>&mdash;about the size of <i>Ranelagh</i>&mdash;The Prisoners
in their Cells, occupying the Circumference&mdash;The Officers, (Governor,
Chaplain, Surgeon, &amp;c.) the Centre.</p>

<p>By <i>Blinds</i>, and other contrivances, the Inspectors concealed (except
in as far as they think fit to show themselves) from the observation
of the Prisoners: hence the sentiment of a sort of invisible
omnipresence.&mdash;The whole circuit reviewable with little, or, if
necessary, without any change of place.</p>

<p><i>One</i> Station in the Inspection-Part affording the most perfect view
of every Cell, and every part of every Cell, unless where a screen is
thought fit occasionally and purposely to be interposed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Against <i>Fire</i> (if, under a system of constant and universal
inspection, any such accident could be to be apprehended,) a
pipe, terminating in a flexible hose, for bringing the water
down into the central Inspection-Room, from a cistern, of a
height sufficient to force it up again by its own pressure,
on the mere turning of a cock, and spread it thus over any
part within the Building.</p></div>

<p>For <i>Visitors</i>, at the time of Divine service, an <i>Annular Gallery</i>,
rising from a floor laid immediately on the cieling of the Central
Inspection-Room, and disclosed to view, by the descent of a central
<i>Dome</i>, the superior surface of which serves, after descent, for the
reception of Ministers, Clerk, and a select part of the Auditory: the
Prisoners all round, brought forward, within perfect view and hearing
of the Ministers, to the front of their respective Cells.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">-489-</a></span></p>

<p><i>Solitude</i>, or <i>limited Seclusion</i>, <i>ad libitum</i>.&mdash;But, unless for
punishment, limited seclusion in assorted companies is preferred: an
arrangement, upon this plan alone, exempt from danger. The degree of
<i>Seclusion</i> fixed upon may be preserved, in all places, and at all
times, <i>inviolate</i>. Hitherto, where solitude has been aimed at, some
of its chief purposes have been frustrated by occasional associations.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The <i>Approach</i>, <i>one</i> only&mdash;<i>Gates</i> opening into a walled
<i>avenue</i> cut through the area. Hence, no strangers near the
building without <i>leave</i>, nor without being <i>surveyed</i> from
it as they pass, nor without being known to come <i>on
purpose</i>. The gates, of <i>open</i> work, to <i>expose hostile</i>
mobs: On the other side of the road, a wall with a branch of
the road behind, to <i>shelter peaceable</i> passengers from the
fire of the building. A mode of fortification like this, if
practicable, in a city, would have saved the <i>London
Prisons</i>, and prevented the unpopular accidents in <i>St.
George's Fields</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>surrounding Wall</i>, itself surrounded by an open
palisade, which serves as a fence to the grounds on the
other side.&mdash;Except on the side of the Approach <i>no public
path</i> by that fence.&mdash;A <i>Centinel's Walk</i> between; on which
no one else can set foot, without forcing the fence, and
declaring himself a trespasser at least, if not an enemy. To
the four walls, four such walks <i>flanking</i> and <i>crossing</i>
each other at the ends.&mdash;Thus each Centinel has two to check
him.</p></div>

<hr class="med" />

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> contemplating the whole of this important design, it is impossible
to avoid congratulating the Public on the prospect which now opens by
a recent vote of Parliament,<a name="FNanchor_153_160" id="FNanchor_153_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_160" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> for the purpose of carrying it
speedily into effect.</p>

<p>It comprizes in its structure every thing humanity can dictate, or
which a mind full of resource, and a judgment matured by great depth
of thought could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">-490-</a></span> suggest, for the purpose of relieving Society from a
dreadful and oppressive evil.</p>

<p>It is even to extend comforts to offenders in the course of
punishment; and they are to be returned to Society after the period
expires, not as at present, polluted and depraved beyond what the
human mind can conceive; but impressed with the force of religious and
moral instructions, with an abhorrence of their former course of life,
and with a resource for obtaining an honest livelihood by the trade or
occupation which they were taught during their confinement.&mdash;And if
employment should fail, when at liberty to make their own election, an
asylum is provided, into which they will be admitted, and where they
may continue to exercise the trades in which they were employed during
their confinement, with certain advantages to themselves.</p>

<p>These Convicts are, moreover, while in confinement, to have an
interest in the work they perform, by being allowed a share of the
produce, which may be either partly or wholly applied in laying the
foundation-stone of a provision for old age, upon the plan of the
Annuity Societies, which is to form one of the &#339;conomical
arrangements of this excellent Establishment.</p>

<p>Among many other advantages calculated to improve the morals of
delinquents, and to render them useful to Society, it will possess,
after a certain period, the singular faculty of extending to the
Public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">-491-</a></span> these incalculable benefits, <i>perhaps without any expence
whatsoever</i>; since it may be reasonably expected, that by training
both Sexes to productive labour, extended and rendered valuable by the
proposed introduction of ingenious machinery, it will hereafter become
an object of advantage to new Contractors, (after the System is fully
matured, and the profits arising from it clearly ascertained), to take
upon them the conduct of the design, without stipulating for any
annuity or assistance whatsoever from Government. Nay, the certainty
of this profit, and its magnitude arising from labour alone, may,
perhaps, ultimately even create a competition of Contractors, who,
instead of <i>receiving</i>, will be induced to <i>offer</i> a premium to
Government for the appointment to the situation; the value of which
will be evidenced by the increasing annual profits.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, highly probable, that as the Institution advances to
maturity, under a plan so admirably adapted to render labour
productive in the greatest possible degree; in the same manner will
the profits gradually increase year after year until they shall be
rendered obvious and certain, and not as at present depending on
speculative opinions.</p>

<p>The proposed annual report to the Court of King's Bench, through which
medium the progressive profits will be generally promulgated, will
create notoriety, and excite attention; and it is by no means
improbable, that when the contract becomes open,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">-492-</a></span> by the decease of
the two Gentlemen to whom the Public are to be indebted for this
invention, that it will acquire <i>a precise value</i>, like any other
saleable commodity.</p>

<p>This was exemplified in the instance of Convicts sent to America,
which for a great length of time cost Government a large sum annually,
until a discovery of the profits, arising from the disposal of the
services of Felons, created a competition, which eased the Public of
every expence whatsoever on account of their Transportation.</p>

<p>But these are not the only advantages which the Country will derive
from this new Penitentiary System. Its success will rapidly change the
&#339;conomy of the many unproductive Houses of Correction, which have
been erected at an enormous expence to the different Counties, under
the Act of the 16th of Geo. III. cap. 43. Those in the management of
these respective Establishments will gladly follow an example which
mingles in so great a degree&mdash;<i>humanity with reform and profit</i>,
thereby holding out a prospect both of diminishing crimes, and
reducing the County Rates, now estimated by the Finance Committee at
<i>fifty thousand pounds a year</i> for prisons, and criminal Police alone.</p>

<p>Such are some of the benefits which may be reasonably expected to
arise from the proposed Penitentiary System. If they shall be realized
to the extent which is contemplated, so as to render transportation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">-493-</a></span>
as well as the Hulks, unnecessary, the pecuniary saving to Government
in twenty years will be immense. This may be ascertained by referring
to a <a href="#Page_465">preceding page</a>, where the disbursements in the criminal
department are inserted, which have taken place since the commencement
of the American war, which rendered a new System necessary. If to this
sum is added the expences incurred by the Counties, it will probably
be found to have exceeded <i>Two millions sterling in all</i>.</p>

<p>But still further advantages may be contemplated in addition to those
of a pecuniary nature.&mdash;By retaining delinquents in the Country, and
rendering their labour profitable to the State, a new source of wealth
is opened which never existed at any former period, since the labour
of convicts transported, whether to America or New South Wales, has
been totally unproductive to the Country.</p>

<p>The success of such a design, once clearly manifested, would give a
new and favourable turn to the System of Punishments. Labour would be
exacted in almost every case, not more for the benefit of the State
than the advantage of the Prisoner, since labour and reform generally
go hand in hand.&mdash;Without the aid of labour, it is in vain to expect
an improvement in the morals or habits of delinquents&mdash;without an
asylum to which discharged prisoners can resort for employment, their
punishment produces no advantage. On the contrary, the vices of a
Gaol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">-494-</a></span> send them forth more hardened in iniquity, and greater adepts in
the trade of thieving than before.</p>

<p>Nothing, therefore, can be more hostile to the diminution of crimes
than the present mode of punishment for small offences, by a short
imprisonment, without being employed in useful and productive labour.</p>

<p>Under this defective System the different Gaols in the Metropolis and
the Kingdom, are periodically vomiting forth hordes of Minor
Delinquents, who serve as recruits to the more desperate gangs, and
remain in a course of turpitude until cut off by the commission of
higher offences. Some exceptions, doubtless, there are; but while the
resource for honest labour is so effectually shut out, many who have
totally lost character, and are without friends, seem to have no other
resource.</p>

<p>To all who may be confined in the proposed Penitentiary Establishment,
this difficulty will be removed.&mdash;A difficulty in the present state of
things, the magnitude of which cannot be estimated, since it generates
most of those evils to which are to be attributed the extensive
corruption of morals, and the increase and multiplication of crimes.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, it would be expedient to give full effect to the new
Penitentiary System as soon as possible; which, to use the language of
the Select Committee, (p. 30.) "seems to bid fairer than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">-495-</a></span> other
that was ever yet offered to the Public, to diminish the Public
expenditure in this branch, and to produce a salutary reform in the
objects of the proposed institution."</p>

<p>At the same time for the purpose of rendering the System of
Punishments useful in the greatest possible degree to the Community,
and that they may operate, in the fullest extent, as an example,
tending to the prevention of crimes, it would seem that the following
general principles should be adopted.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1st. That examples of punishment by death, (except, perhaps,
in cases of Murder), should only take place twice a year:
and that the impression upon the Public mind may be stronger
from the less frequency of such painful exhibitions, they
ought on all occasions to be conducted with a degree of
solemnity suited to the object in the view of the
Legislature, when the life of a fellow-creature is
sacrificed, that it may really prove useful in deterring
others; and not be contemplated with indifference, as is too
often the case at present, without making the least
impression, or being in any degree beneficial to the great
ends of Public justice.</p>

<p>2d. That the System of the Hulks should be at once wholly
abandoned, as a source of great expence, producing in the
result infinitely more evil than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">-496-</a></span> good, and thereby
exhausting the Finances of the Country without any one
beneficial consequence.</p>

<p>3d. That Transportation to New South Wales and Norfolk
Island, should be limited to a few of the most depraved,
incorrigible, and irreclaimable Convicts, whose vicious and
ungovernable conduct, while under the discipline of a
Penitentiary House, rendered their reform hopeless.&mdash;That
shipments should only take place once in three years, and
that the Civil and Military Establishment of the Colony
should be gradually reduced, so as to bring the National
Expenditure on this branch of Police within moderate bounds.</p>

<p>4th. That every thing should be done to accelerate the
erection of National Penitentiary Houses.&mdash;That their
capacity, including appendages, should be equal to the
accommodation of 3,500 Convicts of all descriptions, so as
to admit of different degrees of treatment and labour,
according to the <i>age, sex, and state of health of the
Convicts</i>.</p>

<p>5th. That the local Penitentiary Houses in the different
Counties, destined for the Punishment of persons convicted
of Larcenies, and other minor offences, should be conducted,
as nearly as possible, upon the plan of the National
Establishments; and also by contract, under circumstances
where the labour of the Convicts may, by the resources<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">-497-</a></span> of
the Contractor, be rendered (without hardship) equal, or
nearly equal, to the expence; a measure conceived to be
almost, in every instance, practicable, where knowledge of
business, stimulated by interest, shall form an ingredient
in the executive management.</p>

<p>6th. That there should be attached to each County
Penitentiary House, a Subsidiary Establishment, into which
all discharged prisoners should be admitted who choose it,
and where they might be continued in the exercise of the
trades in which they were employed during their confinement,
and for which they should receive wages in proportion to
their earnings, until they could otherwise find a settled
employment through an honest medium: thus giving those who
are desirous of reforming an opportunity of sheltering
themselves from the dangers of relapse, which arise from
being afloat upon the Public&mdash;idle, and without the means of
subsistence.</p></div>

<p>In carrying the Penitentiary System into effect, it ought not to
escape notice, that the hardship imposed on Convicts, with respect to
manual labour, would be no more than every honest artisan who works
industriously for his family, must, during the whole course of his
life, impose upon himself. The condition of a Convict would, even in
some respects, be superior, inasmuch as he would enjoy medical
assistance, and other advantages tending to the pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">-498-</a></span>servation of
health, which do not attach to the lower classes of the people, whose
irregularities not being restrained, while their pursuits and labours
are seldom directed by good judgment and intelligence, often produce
bad health, and extreme indigence and distress.</p>

<p>The difficulty which has heretofore been experienced with respect to
productive labour in the Provincial Houses of Correction will vanish,
when the System shall be exemplified in the National Penitentiary
Establishment. To conduct a Plan of this nature with advantage to the
Public and to the individual, an assemblage of <i>qualities</i>,
<i>dispositions</i>, and <i>endowments</i>, which rarely meet in one man, will
be necessary&mdash;namely, <i>education, habits of business, a knowledge of
the common affairs of life&mdash;an active and discriminating
mind&mdash;indefatigable industry&mdash;the purest morals, and a philanthropic
disposition, totally divested of those hurtful propensities which lead
to idle amusements</i>.</p>

<p>Such men are to be found, and would come forward, as Contractors, with
ample security as often as opportunities offered, after the System
became matured. It is only by the uncontrolled energy of talents,
where duty and interest go hand in hand, that labour is to be obtained
from Convicts.&mdash;No fluctuating management, nor any superintendance
whatsoever, where a spring is not given to exertion by motives of
interest, can perfect any Penitentiary design; or, indeed, any design
where profit is to be derived from labour. Hence the ill success of
almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">-499-</a></span> all the well meant establishments with respect to the Poor,
and to most of the local Penitentiary Houses. In some instances a few
establishments at first hold out prospects of success; but at length
they dwindle and decay, and in the result they have mostly all been
unprofitable. The death or removal of an active or philanthropic
Magistrate produces a languor, which terminates often in the ruin or
the abandonment of the design.</p>

<p>The National Penitentiary System is guarded against this contingency;
and until the local Establishments can enjoy equal advantages, success
in any degree is scarcely to be expected, and <i>permanent success</i> is
altogether hopeless.</p>

<p>The object to be attained is of great magnitude.&mdash;Let an appeal be,
therefore, made to the good sense of the country, and to the feelings
of humanity in behalf of an unfortunate and noxious class of
individuals. Let the effects of the present System be candidly
examined, in opposition to the benefits which may result from that
which is proposed, and let the decision be speedy, that Society may no
longer be tormented by the evils which arise from this branch of the
Police of the country.</p>

<p>The suggestions which are thus hazarded on the subject of punishments,
are by no means the refinements of speculation doubtful and uncertain
in their issue.</p>

<p>The System accords either with what has been already enacted by the
Legislature or recommended by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">-500-</a></span> the Finance Committee. And the whole
has been admitted to be practicable under an able and permanent
superintendence. A hope may, therefore, be indulged, that where the
interest of Society and the cause of Humanity is so deeply concerned,
a design which holds out so many advantages, will experience that
general support which it unquestionably merits; since its object is
not only to reclaim the Out-casts of the present generation, but also
to rescue thousands yet unborn from misery and destruction.</p>

<p><span class="cap">H</span>AVING in the preceding Chapters endeavoured to bring under the review
of the Reader, not only those prominent causes which have occasioned
that great increase of Public Wrongs, which every good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">-503-</a></span> man must
deplore, but also the <i>various classes of delinquents</i> which compose
the melancholy catalogue of human depravity; having also stated such
observations and facts, relative to <i>detection</i>, <i>trials</i>, and
<i>punishments</i>, as seemed to be necessary for the purpose of
elucidating a subject of great importance to be understood; it remains
now to explain and develope the <i>System</i> hitherto established for the
purpose of protecting the Public against those enormities; and from
which is to be expected that energy, and those exertions, which have
been shewn to be so indispensably necessary, for the suppression and
prevention of crimes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Police</span> <i>of this great Metropolis</i> is undoubtedly a System highly
interesting to be understood, although heretofore (as far as the
Author has had access to know) it has never been, at any period, fully
explained through the medium of the press;&mdash;and hence it is, that a
vast proportion of those who reside in the Capital, as well as the
multitude of strangers who resort to it, have no accurate idea of the
principles of organization, which move so complicated a machine.</p>

<p>It has been already stated in a <a href="#CHAP_XIV">preceding Chapter</a>, that twenty-six
Magistrates, forming that respectable body, comprehending the
Lord-Mayor and Aldermen,<a name="FNanchor_154_161" id="FNanchor_154_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_161" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> sit in rotation every forenoon, at the
Mansion-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">-504-</a></span>house, and at Guildhall, and take cognizance of all matters
of Police within the ancient jurisdiction of the City of London; while
twenty-six established Magistrates appointed for every other part of
the Metropolis,<a name="FNanchor_155_162" id="FNanchor_155_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_162" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> including the River Police, having particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">-505-</a></span>
offices or courts of justice assigned them at convenient distances in
Westminster, Middlesex, and Surry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">-506-</a></span> sit every day (Sunday excepted)
both in the morning and evening, for the purpose of executing all the
multifarious duties, connected with the office of a Justice of the
Peace, which unavoidably occur in large societies.<a name="FNanchor_156_163" id="FNanchor_156_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_163" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>This Institution of established Justices (except with regard to the
three Magistrates at Bow-street, and the Justices at the Marine Police
Office,) was suggested to the Legislature, in consequence of the
pressure felt by the Public, from the want of some regular and
properly-constituted Tribunals for the distribution of justice; where
the System should be uniform; and where the purity of the Magistrates,
and their regular attendance, might insure to the People, the
adjustment of their differences, at the least possible expence; and
the assistance of gratuitous advice in every difficulty; as well as
official aid, in all cases within the sphere of the Magistrates in
their respective districts.</p>

<p>The duty of these established Magistrates, (in conjunction with other
Justices of the Peace, who find it convenient to give their
assistance,) extends also to several important judicial proceedings;
where, in a great variety of instances, they are empowered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">-507-</a></span>
required to <i>hear</i> and <i>determine</i>, in a summary way; particularly in
cases relative to the <i>customs, excise, and stamps&mdash;the game
laws&mdash;hawkers and pedlars&mdash;pawn-brokers&mdash;friendly
societies&mdash;highways&mdash;hackney coaches, carts, and other
carriages&mdash;Quakers and others refusing to pay tythes&mdash;appeals of
defaulters in parochial rates&mdash;misdemeanors committed by persons
unlawfully pawning property not their own&mdash;bakers for short weight,
&amp;c.&mdash;journeymen leaving their services in different trades&mdash;labourers
not complying with their agreements&mdash;disorderly apprentices&mdash;alehouse
keepers keeping disorderly houses&mdash;nuisances by different Acts of
Parliament&mdash;acts of vagrancy by fraudulent lottery
insurers&mdash;fortune-tellers; or persons of evil fame found in avenues to
public places, with an intent to rob&mdash;As well as a multitude of other
offences, in which Justices have power to proceed to conviction and
punishment, either by fine or imprisonment</i>.</p>

<p>The duty of the Magistrates also extends to a vast number of other
objects, such as <i>licencing Public Houses</i>, and establishing Rules and
Orders for Publicans,<a name="FNanchor_157_164" id="FNanchor_157_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_164" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> <i>watching over the conduct of
Publicans&mdash;swearing in, charging and instructing parochial constables
and headboroughs from year to year, with regard to their duty&mdash;issuing
warrants for privy searches; and in considering the cases of persons
charged with being disorderly persons, or rogues and vagabonds, liable
to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">-508-</a></span> punished under the Act of the 17th of George II. cap. 5, and
subsequent acts of Parliament&mdash;in making orders to Parish Officers,
Beadles, and Constables, in a variety of cases&mdash;in Parish Removals&mdash;in
billeting soldiers&mdash;in considering the cases of poor persons applying
for assistance, or admission to workhouses&mdash;in granting certificates
and orders to the wives of persons serving in the Militia</i>, and also
<i>in attesting recruits, for the Army&mdash;in attending the General and
Quarter Sessions of the Peace, and in visiting the Workhouses,
Bride-wells, and Prisons</i>.<a name="FNanchor_158_165" id="FNanchor_158_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_165" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>In addition to these various duties, many criminal cases occur in the
course of a year, which are examined for the purpose, if necessary, of
being sent to superior tribunals for trials:&mdash;such as charges of
<i>Treason, Murder, Coining, and uttering Base Money, Arson,
Manslaughter, Forgery, Burglary, Larceny, Sedition, Felonies of
various descriptions, Conspiracies, Frauds, Riots, Assaults, and
Misdemeanors of different kinds</i>:&mdash;all which unavoidably impose upon
every official Magistrate, a weight of business requiring great
exertion, and an unremitting attention to the Public Interest, in the
due execution of this very important Trust.</p>

<p>When the Police System was first established in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">-509-</a></span> the year 1792, the
public mind became impressed with an idea that the chief, if not the
only, object of the institution was to prevent <i>Robberies</i>,
<i>Burglaries</i>, and other <i>atrocious Offences</i>; and that the suppression
of those crimes, which bore hardest upon Society, and were most
dreaded by the Public at large, was to be the result. These
expectations shewed, that neither the powers nor authorities granted
by the Act of Parliament, nor the other duties imposed upon the
Magistracy of the Police, were understood. For this Statute (useful as
it certainly is in a very high degree in many other respects,) does
not contain even a single regulation applicable to the prevention of
crimes; except that which relates to the apprehension of suspected
characters, found in the avenues to public places, with intent to
commit felony; who are liable to be punished as rogues and
vagabonds,&mdash;and even this provision does not extend to the city of
London.</p>

<p>But this is not all&mdash;an establishment has been created, without the
most necessary of all engines to give vigour and effect to the
exertions of the Magistrates; namely, a pecuniary Fund to defray the
expences of detecting criminals, and of rewarding those who bring
informations useful to Public Justice. The expence of each Public
Office being restricted to <i>two thousand pounds</i> a year, and the
establishment in <i>salaries</i>, <i>rents</i>, <i>taxes</i>, and other
<i>contingencies</i> exhausting that sum, nothing remains for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">-510-</a></span> of the
most necessary purposes of the Institution&mdash;the <i>Prevention</i> and the
<i>Suppression of Crimes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_159_166" id="FNanchor_159_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_166" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>It is in vain to expect that either vigour or energy can enter into
that part of the System, where a great deal of <i>both</i> is necessary,
<i>without Funds</i>.</p>

<p>If criminals, at war with the Community, are to be detected&mdash;if risks
are to be run to effect this purpose&mdash;if it is to be done, (as it must
frequently be) at the hazard of the loss of health, and <i>even of
life</i>, by watching desperadoes in the night time&mdash;if accurate
informations are necessary, either to discover where stolen property
is deposited, or where the delinquents are to be found; a Fund must be
provided, or the Public cannot be protected. Those, whose province it
is to watch over the Police must not expect that men, capable of
giving them useful information, will return a second time, if they
have not some adequate reward bestowed upon them for their labour,
risk, and trouble. Without such power of granting small rewards, (so
far as that part of his duty which relates to the discovery of
property plundered, and the de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">-511-</a></span>tection of the offenders is of
importance to the Public,) a Magistrate is placed in the situation of
a person pledged to work, <i>without tools or implements of labour</i>, by
which he can in any respect accomplish his purpose. And hence it is,
that among the numerous causes assigned in the course of this Work,
for the increase of Crimes,&mdash;this is none of the least.</p>

<p>Not that it is meant that any additional burthen on the Public, by an
extensive expenditure of money, would be necessary&mdash;A very moderate
sum judiciously and &#339;conomically laid out, would bring to
Commissioners of the Police, or to the <i>disbursing Magistrates</i>,
through some medium or other, an early account of most of the
depredations committed upon the Public, as well as every circumstance
relative to coiners and sellers of base money.&mdash;This would lead to the
detection and apprehension of most of the offenders; and thereby
strike such an universal terror, as (assisted by the other salutary
regulations proposed in this Work) would soon reduce the number of
Thieves, Coiners, and other delinquents; and thus, of course, diminish
the ultimate and great additional expence which follows conviction, in
all cases where felons are in the course of punishment.</p>

<p>In this view of the subject, it would prove a Regulation calculated
greatly to reduce the aggregate expence; for surely, if <i>a few
guineas</i> judiciously laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">-512-</a></span> out, in the first instance, would save
<i>fifty</i> afterwards to the State, it must be a wise and a good
arrangement; and in this way it would probably operate. But this would
not be the only saving to the Nation: by preventing crimes, all those
concerned in projects of mischief must, instead of preying upon the
industry of others, assist the State, by contributing their share to
the national stock of labour.</p>

<p>Next to the want of a sufficient pecuniary Fund, the most obvious
deficiency in the present System of executive Police in the
Metropolis, is that which regards the Magistracy of the City of
London; <i>where the case is precisely reversed</i>; for <i>there</i> the funds
for the detection and discovery of offenders, may be made as ample as
the Corporation shall think fit; but the want of a <i>Stipendiary
Establishment</i> must prevent the operation of that System of vigour and
energy, which the increase of Criminals and the present state of
Society demand.</p>

<p>The Magistrates of the City of London form a body, perhaps the most
<i>respectable</i>, and <i>independent</i> of any in the world; but besides the
unavoidable, important, and multiplied affairs of the Corporation, in
attending the various Courts of the Lord-Mayor&mdash;Aldermen&mdash;Common
Council&mdash;Common Hall&mdash;Wardmotes&mdash;Conservancy&mdash;Courts of
Requests&mdash;Court of Orphans&mdash;and General and Quarter Sessions of the
Peace, and Justice Hall at the Old Bailey, they have avocations and
engagements in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">-513-</a></span> business, which must necessarily occupy their minds.
It cannot, therefore, reasonably be expected, that they should forego
their own important private interests, and bestow upon the business of
the Public that attention which their situation as Magistrates seems
to require.<a name="FNanchor_160_167" id="FNanchor_160_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_167" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The Chief Magistrate cannot, in the nature of things, while the
immense load of municipal affairs, joined to his own private concerns,
presses constantly upon his mind, bestow either time or attention in
considering the cases of delinquents brought before him; or in
following up informations, and devising plans necessary to detect
offenders; and yet this detail of duty, even from the pass-vagrant to
the most atrocious villain, is imposed on him, by ancient immemorial
custom and usage; at the very moment when he is overpowered with other
official business, of great magnitude and importance; which can be
transacted by no other person. Hurried with constant engagements,
inseparable from the functions and dignity attached to his high
office, and the general government of the City, a Lord-Mayor is just
beginning to understand the duties attached to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">-514-</a></span> Chief Magistracy,
at the period when he must lay it down.</p>

<p>The other Magistrates of the City having had a precise line of duty
anciently chalked out, when Commerce and Society had made less
progress, the same System continues; nor would it be proper to expect
an augmentation of labour, or a greater proportion of time, from
Magistrates who serve the Public gratuitously.&mdash;The unremitting
attendance and indefatigable industry, which the Public interest
requires, it would be vain and unjust to expect, from any but
Magistrates selected for that purpose, and that only.<a name="FNanchor_161_168" id="FNanchor_161_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_168" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">-515-</a></span></p>
<p>With the increase of those blessings which are supposed to arise from
a course of prosperity and wealth, there is generally an increase also
of <i>evils</i> and <i>inconveniences</i>; and hence it is that while an influx
of riches preponderates in <i>one scale</i>, an augmentation of crimes acts
as a counterbalance in the <i>other</i>:&mdash;thus requiring the constant and
progressive application of such antidotes and remedies as will
preserve the <i>good</i>, while the <i>evil</i> is diminished or kept within
bounds.</p>

<p>It seems that the Metropolis is now in that situation where the active
and unceasing attention of Magistrates with salaries, has become
necessary to promote a vigorous and energetic execution of the Law,
for the general protection of property, and the safety of
individuals.<a name="FNanchor_162_169" id="FNanchor_162_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_169" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">-516-</a></span></p><p>Contemplating the various existing evils detailed in this Work, and
which form so many prominent features of Police, requiring the
constant and watchful eye of the Magistrate, it seems clear to
demonstration, that unless official duties become the sole business
and pursuit of the parties engaged in them, the Public Interest must
suffer; and (although imperceptible in their progress), Crimes will
increase and multiply; at a time when the comfort, happiness and
security of Society, require that they should be diminished.</p>

<p>In consequence also of the great accumulation of the Statute Laws,
requiring the attention of Justices in a vast number of instances,
which did not occur a century ago, their duty has so multiplied as to
require the <i>whole time</i> of Magistrates acting in all great Societies;
an observation which applies not merely to the Metropolis, but to many
large Provincial Towns. It follows, therefore, almost as a matter of
course, that Stipendiary Justices have become indispensably
necessary.<a name="FNanchor_163_172" id="FNanchor_163_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_172" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">-517-</a></span></p>
<p>If men of business, integrity, and talents, could once be prevailed on
to accept of such employments, and execute the trust reposed in them
with zeal and attention to the public interest, and with firm and
independent minds, attached to no Party, infinite advantages must
result to the Community from their services.<a name="FNanchor_164_173" id="FNanchor_164_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_173" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Where men of this description pledge themselves, as they must
necessarily do, to give up every other pursuit, assiduously and
constantly to execute the laborious duties of a Police Magistrate;
Justice also requires that the reward should be commensurate to the
sacrifices which are made. It is the interest of the Community that it
should be so: for in the present extended state of Commerce and
Society, no gratuitous System can ever be expected to answer any
purpose of real utility.</p>

<p>While the higher order of Magistrates receive the just reward of their
useful labour, bestowed in the exercise of their functions in
promoting the public good&mdash;where can be the impropriety of extending
the same species of remuneration to inferior Magistrates; who must
devote even a greater portion of time and attention to the
multifarious duties assigned them?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">-518-</a></span></p>

<p>The office of <i>Assistant Magistrates</i> in the City might be assigned to
six active and honourable men, who would give <i>their whole attention
to</i> the criminal department of the Police. The proceedings of these
Magistrates should be sanctioned by the presence of the Aldermen, as
often as one or more could conveniently attend; on which occasions
they would necessarily preside, as holding within their own district,
the highest rank in the Magistracy.</p>

<p>The difference in point of benefit to the Community between a <i>Mind</i>
constantly occupied in objects of public utility, and that which is
only occasionally employed, is great beyond all possible
calculation.&mdash;Nor is the measure without precedent, even in the City
of London, since the Recorder may, in his high office, be fairly
considered in the light of a Magistrate with a salary.</p>

<p>Ready on every occasion at their Sittings in the morning and evening,
to offer their advice or assistance to the labouring people, as well
as all ranks of the Community, who apply for it&mdash;to adjust their
differences, and to protect them against wrongs and oppressions:
prepared also, as a matter of business, to receive and follow up
informations where crimes have been committed, and never to lose sight
of the object while it is practicable to attain it; these Assistant
Magistrates would afford incalculable advantages to the City: which
would be still farther increased, if a System of co-operation of the
other Police Magistrates were established, upon a plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">-519-</a></span> which would
unite their energy, and render their jurisdiction co-extensive. (See
<i>ante</i> pages <a href="#Page_419">419</a>, <a href="#Page_420">420</a>).</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact, that since the establishment of Police
Magistrates for Westminster, and the parts of Middlesex and Surry,
contiguous to the City of London, great benefits have been experienced
from the assistance and advice which have been afforded to the
indigent, and the ignorant.</p>

<p>Many quarrels and little law-suits have been prevented, and
innumerable differences immediately reconciled without any expence.</p>

<p>It is in this manner that Magistrates, acting up to the spirit of
their Public Duty, and bestowing their <i>whole</i> attention upon whatever
relates to that duty, confer those obligations upon the Community
which no moderate remuneration can repay.</p>

<p>The office of a Police Magistrate is not like other public
situations:&mdash;for the business is multifarious, seldom admits of any
recess or a vacation.&mdash;It is, or ought to be, <i>constant</i>, <i>laborious</i>,
and without <i>intermission</i>.<a name="FNanchor_165_174" id="FNanchor_165_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_174" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">-520-</a></span></p>
<p>But with all these advantages, even improved by competent funds
appropriated to the different Public Offices, still a <i>Centre-point</i>
is wanted to connect the whole together, so as to invigorate and
strengthen every part, by a superintending Establishment, under the
immediate controul of the Secretary of State for the Home Department:
There, indeed, the constitutional superintendence of the Police of the
Metropolis, as well as of the whole country, rests at present; but
from the vast weight and increase of other Public Business, connected
with the general affairs of the State, foreign, colonial, and
domestic, it has been found impracticable to pursue that particular
System which has now become, more than ever, necessary for the
detection of criminals. It seems then, that in executing a task so
complicated and multifarious, a delegation of subordinate <i>Responsible
Management</i> to a <i>Central Board of Police</i> should be resorted to: as
the only means of giving strength, vigour, and energy to a System,
heretofore only partially useful; and which, in its present disjointed
state, is incapable of extending that Protection and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">-521-</a></span> Security, which
has been shewn in the course of this Work, to be so much wanted, and
so indispensably necessary.</p>

<p>To understand the Police of the Metropolis to that extent which is
necessary to direct and superintend its general operations, it must be
acted upon <i>practically</i>; and those who undertake the
<i>superintendence</i> and <i>management</i> alluded to, must be men <i>able</i>,
<i>intelligent</i>, <i>prudent</i>, and <i>indefatigable</i>: devoting their whole
attention to this object alone. Clerks might be continually employed
with great advantage in entering and posting up under the proper
heads, such new information as should be obtained from day to day; and
hours should be appointed for receiving such intelligence from all
proper and well-informed persons, who might choose to offer the same;
so far as such information related to Public wrongs, and offences
against the peace, safety, and well-being of Society.</p>

<p>Under such a System, with a proper power of remunerating Officers and
others, scarcely a <i>Robbery</i>, <i>Burglary</i>, <i>Larceny</i>, or <i>fraudulent
Transaction</i>, could be committed, where the perpetrators would not be
very speedily detected and brought to justice; for then the
Magistrates, in their respective districts, would be enabled to act
with confidence, vigour, and energy, in the discovery and apprehension
of offenders;&mdash;and the effect would be to excite a general terror in
the minds of every class of delinquents; which could not fail to
operate strongly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">-522-</a></span> a means of preventing crimes, and improving the
morals and the happiness of the lower orders of the People.</p>

<p>In addition to this these responsible Commissioners of Police might,
with great propriety, and with no little public utility, have
committed to them the superintendence of <i>all Receipts and
Disbursements of the accounts</i>, and of <i>all monies applicable to
objects of Police</i>: these they should lay annually before Parliament,
if required, accompanied by a General Report; that the Legislature, as
well as the Public at large, might see in what manner the funds had
been applied; and what progress had been made in the prevention of
crimes, and in restoring among the Labouring People that sense of
morality, which never, perhaps, was at a lower ebb than at present.</p>

<p>The most enlightened Foreigners who have visited this Metropolis, and
contemplated the nature and organization of our Police System, join in
one general remark upon it; viz.&mdash;"<i>That we have some shadow of
Police, for apprehending Delinquents, after crimes are actually
committed; but none for the purpose of preventing them</i>."&mdash;This
certainly is, in one sense, literally true;&mdash;and from this source,
combined with the imperfection of the Criminal Code, have arisen all
those enormities and inconveniences already so amply detailed.</p>

<p>Attached to the Laws and Government of his country, even to a degree
of enthusiasm, the Author of this Work will not be too prone to seek
for greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">-523-</a></span> perfection in other nations: or to quote them as examples
to be imitated in the Metropolis of the British Empire; and still less
if such examples should tend, in the slightest degree, to abridge that
freedom which is the birth-right of every Briton. But as all true
liberty depends on those fences which are established in every
Country, for the protection of the Persons and Property of the People,
against every attack whatsoever: and as prejudices ought to be
banished from the mind in all discussions tending to promote the
General Weal, we ought not to be ashamed of borrowing good Systems
from other Nations; wherever such can be adopted, consistent with the
Constitution of the Country, and the Liberty of the Subject.</p>

<p>In France, under the Old Government, how much soever many parts of the
System of that Country were justly reprobated, by all who were
acquainted with the blessings of Freedom, yet, in the management and
regulation of what was denominated <i>The Police</i>, there existed that
kind of Establishment, with regard to personal security, and
protection against the depredations of the most depraved part of the
community, which Englishmen have certainly never enjoyed; who, on the
contrary, have suffered manifold inconveniences from an idea, (surely
a very erroneous one,) "that we must endure these public wrongs, and
expose our property and lives to the attack of murderers, robbers, and
highwaymen, as the price of <i>Liberty</i>."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">-524-</a></span></p>

<p>When difficulties are felt, it is our duty to look at them
dispassionately; to face them with fortitude, and to discuss them with
intelligence&mdash;divested of all prejudices generated merely by habit and
education. By pursuing this mode of investigation, it will be
discovered that in other Governments there may be some Establishments
worthy of imitation; and which, perhaps, might in part be adopted, not
only in perfect consistency with the Freedom of the Subject; but with
the advantage of extending to the mass of the People, who are not in a
course of delinquency, more real liberty than they at present enjoy.&mdash;</p>

<p>At the commencement of the troubles in France, it is a curious fact,
that the Lieutenant-General of the National Police, as well as that of
the Metropolis, had upon his Registers the names of not less than
twenty thousand suspected and depraved characters, whose pursuits were
known to be of a criminal nature; yet, by making this part of Police
the immediate object of the close and uniform attention of one branch
of the Executive Government, Crimes were much less frequent than in
England; and the security extended to the Public, with regard to the
protection of Life and Property against lawless depredation, was
infinitely greater.&mdash;To elucidate this assertion, and to shew to what
a wonderful height the System had advanced, the Reader is referred to
the following Anecdotes; which were mentioned to the Author by a
Foreign Minister of great intelli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">-525-</a></span>gence and information, who resided
some years at the Court of France.</p>

<p>"A Merchant of high respectability in Bourdeaux had occasion to visit
the Metropolis upon commercial business, carrying with him bills and
money to a very large amount.</p>

<p>"On his arrival at the gates of Paris, a genteel looking man opened
the door of his carriage, and addressed him to this effect:&mdash;<i>Sir, I
have been waiting for you some time; according to my notes, you were
to arrive at this hour; and your person, your carriage, and your
portmanteau, exactly answering the description I hold in my hand, you
will permit me to have the honour of conducting you to Monsieur De
Sartine.</i></p>

<p>"The Gentleman, astonished and alarmed at this interruption, and still
more so at hearing the name of the Lieutenant of the Police mentioned,
demanded to know what <i>Monsieur De Sartine</i> wanted with him; adding,
at the same time, that he never had committed any offence against the
Laws, and that he could have no right to interrupt or detain him.</p>

<p>"The Messenger declared himself perfectly ignorant of the cause of the
detention; stating, at the same time, that when he had conducted him
to <i>Monsieur De Sartine</i>, he should have executed his orders, which
were merely ministerial.</p>

<p>"After some further explanations, the Gentleman permitted the Officer
to conduct him accordingly. <i>Monsieur De Sartine</i> received him, with
great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">-526-</a></span> politeness; and after requesting him to be seated, to his great
astonishment, he described his portmanteau; and told him the exact sum
in bills and specie which he had brought with him to Paris, and where
he was to lodge, his usual time of going to bed, and a number of other
circumstances, which the Gentleman had conceived could only be known
to himself.&mdash;<i>Monsieur De Sartine</i> having thus excited attention, put
this extraordinary question to him&mdash;<i>Sir, are you a man of
courage?</i>&mdash;The Gentleman, still more astonished at the singularity of
such an interrogatory, demanded the reason why he put such a strange
question, adding, at the same time, that no man ever doubted his
courage. <i>Monsieur De Sartine</i> replied,&mdash;<i>Sir, you are to be robbed
and murdered this night!&mdash;If you are a man of courage, you must go to
your hotel, and retire to rest at the usual hour: but be careful that
you do not fall asleep; neither will it be proper for you to look
under the bed, or into any of the closets which are in your
bed-chamber</i>; (which he accurately described);&mdash;<i>you must place your
portmanteau in its usual situation, near your bed, and discover no
suspicion:&mdash;Leave what remains to me.&mdash;If, however, you do not feel
your courage sufficient to bear you out, I will procure a person who
shall personate you, and go to bed in your stead.</i></p>

<p>"The Gentleman being convinced, in the course of the conversation,
that <i>Monsieur de Sartine's</i> intelligence was accurate in every
particular, he refused to be personated, and formed an immediate
resolu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">-527-</a></span>tion, literally, to follow the directions he had received: he
accordingly went to bed at his usual hour, which was eleven
o'clock.&mdash;At half past twelve (the time mentioned by <i>Monsieur De
Sartine</i>), the door of the bed-chamber burst open, and three men
entered with a <i>dark lantern</i>, <i>daggers</i> and <i>pistols</i>.&mdash;The
Gentleman, who of course was awake, perceived one of them to be his
own servant.&mdash;They rifled his portmanteau, undisturbed, and settled
the plan of putting him to death.&mdash;The Gentleman, hearing all this,
and not knowing by what means he was to be rescued, it may naturally
be supposed, was under great perturbation of mind during such an awful
interval of suspense; when, at the moment the villains were preparing
to commit the horrid deed, four Police Officers, acting under <i>Mons.
De Sartine's</i> orders, who were concealed under the bed, and in the
closet, rushed out and seized the offenders with the property in their
possession, and in the act of preparing to commit the murder.</p>

<p>"The consequence was, that the perpetration of the atrocious deed was
prevented, and sufficient evidence obtained to convict the
offenders.&mdash;<i>Monsieur De Sartine's</i> intelligence enabled him to
<i>prevent</i> this horrid offence of robbery and murder; which, but for
the accuracy of the System, would probably have been carried into
execution."</p>

<p>Another Anecdote, was mentioned to the Author by the same Minister,
relative to the Emperor Joseph the Second: "That Monarch, having, in
the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">-528-</a></span> 1787, formed and promulgated a new Code of Laws relative to
criminal and civil offences;<a name="FNanchor_166_175" id="FNanchor_166_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_175" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and having also established what he
conceived to be the best System of Police in Europe, he could scarcely
ever forgive the French Nation, in consequence of the accuracy and
intelligence of <i>Mons. De Sartine</i> having been found so much superior
to his own; notwithstanding the immense pains he had bestowed upon
that department of his Government.</p>

<p>"A very notorious offender, who was a subject of the Emperor, and who
committed many atrocious acts of violence and depredation at Vienna,
was traced to Paris by the Police established by His Majesty, who
ordered his Ambassador at the Court of France to demand that this
delinquent should be delivered up to Public Justice.</p>

<p>"<i>Mons. De Sartine</i> acknowledged to the Imperial Ambassador, that the
person he inquired after had been in Paris;&mdash;that, if it would be any
satisfaction, he could inform him where he had lodged, and the
different gaming-tables, and other places of infamous resort, which he
frequented while there;&mdash;but that he was now gone.&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Ambassador, after stating the accuracy and correct mode by which
the Police of Vienna was conducted, insisted that this offender must
still be in Paris; otherwise the Emperor would not have commanded him
to make such an application.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">-529-</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Monsieur de Sartine</i> smiled at the incredulity of the Imperial
Minister, and made a reply to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Do me the honour, Sir, to inform the Emperor, your Master, that the
person he looks for left Paris on the 10th day of the last month; and
is now lodged in a back room looking into a garden in the third story
of a house, number 93, in &mdash;&mdash; street, in his own Capital of Vienna;
where his Majesty will, by sending to the spot, be sure to find
him.</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was literally as the French Minister of Police had stated.&mdash;The
Emperor, to his astonishment, found the delinquent in the house and
apartment described; but he was greatly mortified at this proof of the
accuracy of the French Police; which, in this instance, in point of
intelligence <i>even in Vienna</i>, was discovered to be so much superior
to his own."&mdash;</p>

<p>The fact is, that the French System had arrived at the greatest degree
of perfection; and though not necessary, nor even proper, to be copied
as <i>a pattern</i>, might, nevertheless, furnish many useful hints,
calculated to improve the Police of this Metropolis, consistent with
the existing Laws; and even to extend and increase the Liberty of
Subject without taking one privilege away; or interfering in the
pursuits of any one class of individuals; except those employed in
purposes of <i>mischief</i>, <i>fraud</i>, and <i>criminality</i>.</p>

<p>The situation of this Country, (indeed of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">-530-</a></span> country in Europe,)
has changed materially since the dissolution of the ancient Government
of France.&mdash;The horde of sharpers and villains, who heretofore
resorted to Paris from every part of Europe, will now consider London
as their general and most productive theatre of action; for two
obvious reasons:&mdash;1st. Paris being exhausted of riches, its Nobility
banished, and the principal part of the active property there
annihilated, the former resources for the support of criminal and
depraved characters no longer exist; while that Metropolis holds out
no allurements similar to what were formerly experienced. 2dly. The
ignorance of the English language (a circumstance which formerly
afforded us some protection), will no longer be a bar to the resort of
the continental sharpers to the Metropolis of this kingdom. At no
period was it ever so generally understood by Foreigners; or the
French language so universally spoken, by at least the younger part of
the People of this Country.&mdash;</p>

<p>The spirit of gaming and dissipation which prevails in London,
promoted already in no inconsiderable degree by profligate characters
from the Continent, the opulence of the People, and the great mass of
active property in circulation, will afford a wide field for the
exercise of the invention and wits of that description of men, both
foreigners and natives, who infested Paris under the old Government,
and which rendered a more than ordinary attention to its Police
indispensably necessary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">-531-</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The termination of the present war will probably throw into this
country a vast number of idle, profligate, and depraved characters,
natives of this, as well as of other nations, who will require to be
narrowly watched by a vigilant and well-regulated Police. The
probability of such an accession to the numbers already engaged in
acts of delinquency, serves to establish new and incontrovertible
arguments in favour of the proposed <i>Board of Responsible
Commissioners</i>, for managing the affairs of the Police of the
Metropolis; to form a <i>Centre-point</i>, and to bind the System together.</p>

<p>To be well prepared against every possible evil, is one great step
towards prevention; and among the many advantages already detailed, as
likely to result from a <i>Board of Police Revenue</i>, this would be none
of the least.</p>

<p>In every view in which the subject can be considered, such a System,
strengthened by good and apposite Laws, could not fail to be
productive of vast benefits to the Community. <i>Petty Thefts</i> affecting
all ranks who have any property to lose, and destroying the moral
principle, would be greatly abridged:&mdash;as would also the plunder from
vessels in the River Thames, as well as from the public Arsenals,
Dock-yards, and Ships of War. The more atrocious Crimes of Burglary
and Highway Robbery, would suffer a severe check, in the
embarrassments which would arise from the System of detections and
Rewards&mdash;from the restrictions pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">-532-</a></span>posed to be laid upon Receivers of
Stolen Goods; upon Night Coaches,&mdash;and from other regulations
applicable to those particular offences. A large proportion of the
<i>Coiners</i>, <i>Dealers</i>, and <i>Utterers of Base Money</i>, feeling the risk
of detection, as well as of punishment, greatly extended and
increased, would probably abandon the business as hazardous and
destructive. The completion of the General System would also, either
collaterally or immediately, reach the tribe of Cheats, Swindlers, and
Lottery Offenders, in such a manner as to occasion a considerable
reduction of their number, by narrowing the ground, and destroying the
resources by which they at present flourish.</p>

<p>The establishment of such a System would be an immediate benefit to
every man of property, as an individual, independent of the Public at
large; but even in another point of view, it is doubly necessary at
this juncture, when new events are daily occurring, of a nature truly
interesting to the peace and well-being of Society, and to the
tranquillity of the State; rendering it more than ever necessary to
establish a System of unremitting vigilance. It is a fact well
established, that it was principally through the medium, and by the
assistance, of many of the twenty thousand miscreants who were
registered, previous to the anarchy of France, on the books of the
Lieutenant of Police, that the contending Factions in that distracted
country, were enabled to perpetrate those horrid massacres and acts of
atrocity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">-533-</a></span> which have been beheld with detestation, abhorrence, and
astonishment, by every civilized nation in the world.</p>

<p>Let it be recollected, at the same time, that Mankind, in a state of
depravity, arising from a long course of criminal turpitude, are
nearly alike in every country; and that it becomes us to look with a
jealous eye on the several thousand miscreants of the same description
which now infest London; for they too, upon any fatal emergency,
(which <span class="smcap">God</span> forbid!) would be equally ready as their brethren in
iniquity were, in Paris, to repeat the same atrocities, if any
opportunity offered.</p>

<p>As the effectuating such an object has become so great a
desideratum;&mdash;and as it is to confer those blessings which spring from
a well-regulated Police, calculated to extend a species of
protection<a name="FNanchor_167_176" id="FNanchor_167_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_176" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">-534-</a></span> inhabitants of this great Metropolis, which
has never been heretofore experienced:&mdash;it can scarcely fail to be a
matter of general satisfaction to know that the Select Committee of
the House of Commons on Finance, have strongly recommended to
Parliament a System of Police, similar to that which had been
submitted to the consideration of the Public in the former editions of
this Work.</p>

<p>In order that improvements, sanctioned by such high authority, and the
adoption of which are so important to the best interests of Society,
may be fully explained and elucidated; a detail of the measures, which
have been recommended, with general observations on the proposed
System, are reserved for the <a href="#CHAP_XVIII">ensuing Chapter</a>.</p>

<hr class="dbl1" />
<hr class="dbl2" />

<p><span class="cap">I</span>MPRESSED with a deep sense of the utility of investigating the nature
of the Police System, the Select Committee of the House of Commons on
Finance turned their attention to this, among many other important
objects in the Session of the year 1798; and, after a laborious
investigation which occupied several months, (during which period the
Author of this Treatise underwent several examinations),<a name="FNanchor_168_177" id="FNanchor_168_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_177" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> they
made their <i>final Report</i>&mdash;in which, after stating it as their
opinion, "that the general tendency of our &#339;conomical arrangements
upon this subject is ill calculated to meet the accumulating burdens,
which are the infallible result of so much error in our System of
Police"&mdash;they recommended it to Parliament to reduce or consolidate
"the two offices of Hawkers and Pedlars, and Hackney Coaches, into a
Board of Police Revenue, under the direction of a competent number of
Commissioners, with such Salaries as should bid fair to engage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">-537-</a></span>
talents adequate to the situation, and as should be sufficient to
command the whole exertion of those talents.&mdash;That the Receiver of the
Police offices, should be the Receiver-General of the funds proposed
to be collected by this Board.&mdash;That the superintendence of aliens
should form a part of its business.&mdash;That the fees and penalties
received at the several offices of Police, together with the
Licence-duties and penalties, if any, which shall be in the collection
of this consolidated Board, shall make one common fund, out of which
all salaries and expences of the several offices of Police should be
defrayed, as well as all those of the Consolidated Board, and that all
payments whatever should be made by the Receiver, under the sanction
of this Board, subject to the approbation of the Lords Commissioners
of his Majesty's Treasury.&mdash;That the accounts of the Receiver should
be audited and signed by the Board before being delivered to the
Treasury, or the office for auditing accounts.&mdash;That the balances in
the hands of the Receiver, after retaining what may be sufficient for
current expences, should be paid into the Exchequer at frequent and
fixed periods.&mdash;That Magistrates of Police should be impowered to
distribute small rewards to Constables or others, for meritorious
services, to be paid by the Revenue, after receiving the sanction of
the Board: And further, that the Board should have power to make
Bye-laws, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">-538-</a></span> the regulation of such Minor Objects of Police as
relate to the objects of their superintendence, and to the control of
all Coaches, Chairs, Carts, Barrows, and the conduct of all Coachmen,
Chairmen, Carters, &amp;c. and the removal and prevention of annoyances,
and the correction of all offences against the cleanliness, the quiet,
and the free passage of the Streets of the Metropolis, similar to the
powers now possessed by the Commissioners of Hackney Coaches, and
subject in like manner to the approbation of the Superior Judges in
the Courts in Westminster-Hall."&mdash;The Committee further recommend that
two additional Police Offices should be established in the City of
London, consisting each of three Magistrates, to be named by the Lord
Mayor and Aldermen, and paid out of the General funds, and to have
Commissions from the Crown, extending over the whole Metropolis, and
the Counties of Middlesex, Kent, Essex, and Surry; and that the
Commissions of the Magistrates of the other eight Offices should
extend in like manner over the whole Metropolis, and the four
above-mentioned Counties.<a name="FNanchor_169_178" id="FNanchor_169_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_178" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> And finally, the Committee recommend
that no time should be lost in carrying into effect the Plan and
Proposal of Jeremiah Bentham, Esq. for employing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">-539-</a></span> and reforming
Convicts, as a measure which bids fairer than any other that was
offered to the Public, to diminish the Public expenditure in this
branch, and to produce a salutary Reform in the object of the proposed
Institution.</p>

<p>Other measures are stated by this Committee as well calculated to
facilitate the means of detection and conviction of Offenders, and to
reduce the expence which is now borne by the Public, or sustained by
private Individuals, in the maintenance of a very inefficient Police;
while they seem calculated to lessen the growing Calendars of
Delinquency, but which may be better matured after the consolidation
of the Offices here proposed shall have taken place.&mdash;"Such as the
appointment of Counsel for the Crown, with moderate Salaries, to
conduct all Criminal Prosecutions, and rendering the Solicitor to the
Board useful, either in such Prosecutions as any of the Public
Officers might find it necessary to institute; or in such Criminal
Prosecutions at the suit of Individuals, as the Public Justice of the
Country should render expedient.&mdash;Such as a Register of Lodging-houses
in the Metropolis.&mdash;Such as the establishment of a Police Gazette, to
be circulated at a low price, and furnished gratis to all persons
under the superintendence of the Board; who shall pay a licence duty
to a certain amount: And such also as an Annual Report of the state of
the Police of the Country."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">-540-</a></span></p>

<p>In considering this Report in general, it is no slight gratification
to the Author of this Treatise, to discover that all the great
features of his original design for giving to Police its genuine
character, unmixed with those judicial Powers which lead to
punishment, and properly belong to Magistracy alone, have been
sanctioned by such high authority.</p>

<p>In taking a general view not only of what is specifically recommended
by the Select Committee of the House of Commons; but also of the
Report itself, two leading objects appear to be in contemplation,
namely&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1st. The prevention of crimes and misdemeanors, by bringing
under regulations a variety of dangerous and suspicious
trades;<a name="FNanchor_170_179" id="FNanchor_170_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_179" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> the uncontrolled exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">-541-</a></span> of which by persons
of loose conduct, is known to contribute in a very high
degree to the concealment, and by that means to the
encouragement and multiplication of crimes.</p>


<p>2d. To raise a moderate Revenue for Police purposes from the
persons who shall be thus controlled, by means of Licence
Duties, and otherwise so modified as not to operate as a
material burden; while a confident hope is entertained, that
the amount of this revenue will go a considerable length in
relieving the finances of the country, of the expences at
present incurred for objects of Police, and that, in the
effect of the general System, a considerable saving will
arise, in consequence of the expected diminution of crimes,
particularly as the chief part of the expence appears to
arise after delinquents are convicted.<a name="FNanchor_171_180" id="FNanchor_171_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_180" class="fnanchor">[171]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">-542-</a></span></p></div>

<p>By the consolidation of the two Boards of Hackney Coaches, and Hawkers
and Pedlars, the func<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">-543-</a></span>tions of the Commissioners will become very
extensive and laborious, since in addition to the inspection and
control of the different suspicious trades proposed to be licenced, it
will be useful to the Public, and, indeed, the System will be
incomplete, unless they not only keep constantly in their view the
general Calendar of delinquency; but also carry into effect such plans
as, on mature deliberation, and (many will unquestionably be found
practicable), shall, in a great measure, prevent the
terror&mdash;dangers&mdash;losses and inconveniences which arise from foot-pad
and highway robberies, burglaries, and other atrocious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">-544-</a></span> offences,
which are so prevalent in and near the Metropolis at present.&mdash;This
duty will naturally attach to the Central Board, and which the
Commissioners, (from the accurate information their situation will
enable them to procure, and the Civil Force they may have at their
disposal,) will be well qualified to execute with advantage to the
Community; and while competent pecuniary resources will arise from the
Licence Duties imposed, aided by legislative regulations, applicable
to this, and other objects tending to the general prevention of
Crimes, blame may fairly be imputed wherever a considerable degree of
success is not manifest, by the gradual diminution of the more
atrocious, as well as the minor offences.</p>

<p>The Select Committee of the House of Commons having stated it as their
opinion, that the principle upon which the plan which has been brought
under their review is founded, "<i>if liable to no error; and that
supposing it faithfully executed it gives the fairest prospect of
success</i>:" the Public will naturally become anxious for an enjoyment
of the benefits which may be expected to result from its adoption.</p>

<p>As its leading feature is the security of the <i>rights of the
innocent</i>, with respect to their Life, Property, and Convenience, the
measures of this board must, in a peculiar degree, be directed with
prudence and discretion to this particular object. This will be
effected not only by increasing the difficulty of per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">-545-</a></span>petrating
offences, through a control over those Trades by which they are
facilitated and promoted, but also by adding to the risk of detection,
by a more prompt and certain mode of discovery wherever crimes are
committed. Thus must the idle and profligate be compelled to assist
the State, by resorting to habits of industry, while the more
incorrigible delinquents will be intimidated and deterred from
pursuing a course of turpitude and criminality, which the energy of
the Police will render too hazardous and unprofitable to be followed
up as a trade; and the regular accession of numbers to recruit and
strengthen the hordes of criminal delinquents, who at present afflict
Society, will be in a great measure prevented.</p>

<p>These objects (in the opinion of the Select Committee) are to be
attained by the establishment of a <i>Central Board of Police Revenue</i>;
the views of the Members of which should be directed to the means of
adding "Security to the Person and Property of the peaceful Subject;
the Morals of the People, and the general Finances of the Country; by
those powers of action which are likely to operate most beneficially
towards the prevention of Crimes."</p>

<p>To accomplish these purposes it would seem, (after mature
deliberation), to be necessary not only to extend the Licensing System
over the whole Kingdom; but also to form <i>a chain of connection</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">-546-</a></span>
between the Central Board, and every district of the Country, with a
view as well to a more effectual Control ever those suspicious
Traders, who are to become immediate objects of attention on the part
of the Police, as to establish a more correct and certain mode of
collecting the proposed Revenue.</p>

<p>This chain of connection would appear to be only attainable through
the medium of Select local Magistrates,<a name="FNanchor_172_181" id="FNanchor_172_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_181" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> to whom a certain degree
of responsibility would attach, and who by means of Stationary
Surveyors, (being Constables), appointed by themselves, and under
their immediate Control, would be enabled to superintend the
collection of the Licence Duties, and in a particular manner to
inspect into, and regulate the general Police of the District, while
in conjunction with other Justices in the division, they granted the
Annual Licences to the different Dealers upon the same plan which is
at present pursued with respect to Alehouses.</p>

<p>From this general rule, however, on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">-547-</a></span> the peculiar situation
of the Metropolis, a deviation might be necessary and useful to the
Public. It would, therefore, seem that the Dealers resident within a
certain distance round the Metropolis, should receive their Licences
from the Central Board, and be immediately under its control.&mdash;The
advantages resulting from this arrangement are obvious.&mdash;The chief
part of the Receivers, and Criminal Dealers, who contribute in so
great a degree to the increase and concealment of the numerous
offences, which are committed in and near the Metropolis, require that
the superintendance should not be divided, but that it should be
confined entirely to the Board, where all intelligence is supposed to
center; and whose peculiar duty it will be to watch the progress of
Crimes in all their ramifications, and to adopt measures for
preventing the growing corruption of Morals, by which every species of
delinquency is generated.</p>

<p>For the purpose therefore of compassing this and every other object in
the view of the Select Committee, it is suggested that the proposed
Board should be authorized to exercise the following</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h3><span class="gesperrt">FUNCTIONS:</span></h3>

<p>I. To manage that branch of the Police which relates to
Hackney Coaches and Chairs.&mdash;To enforce strictly the laws
now in being for the better ordering this system so
necessary to the comfort and convenience of the
Metropolis.&mdash;To obtain new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">-548-</a></span> powers (where wanting) to compel
a greater degree of cleanliness and security, with respect
to these vehicles.&mdash;To banish, if possible, from the
fraternity those criminal characters denominated <i>Flash
Coachmen</i>, and to secure civility, and prevent
imposition.&mdash;For this last purpose a department should be
continued, as at present, (a part of the Institution,)
having a concurrent jurisdiction with other Magistrates, for
the purpose of hearing and determining disputes between
Coachmen and the Public.</p>

<p>II. To execute the laws relative to Hawkers and Pedlars.&mdash;To
regulate and improve the System respecting this suspicious
class of Dealers, and more effectually to extend the control
over them by means of the Select Magistrates in each
District of the Country where they travel, for the purpose
of more narrowly watching their conduct.</p>

<p>III. To grant Licenses in the Town District (<i>i.e.</i> within
the limits of the Penny-Post, while the Select and other
Justices grant similar Licences in the Country;) under the
authority of the proposed general Police Bill, to the
following Traders, and others,<a name="FNanchor_173_182" id="FNanchor_173_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_182" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> viz.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">-549-</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1st. Purchasers of second-hand, and other Household goods,
for Sale.</p>

<p>2d. Wholesale purchasers of Rags, and unserviceable Cordage,
for Sale to Paper-makers.</p>

<p>3d. Retail Purchasers of Rags, and unserviceable Cordage,
for Sale to Paper-makers.</p>

<p>4th. Purchasers of second-hand Apparel, made-up Piece-Goods,
and Remnants for Sale.</p>

<p>5th. Walking or Itinerant Purchasers of second-hand Apparel,
made-up Piece-goods, and Remnants for Sale.</p>

<p>6th. Purchasers of second-hand Naval Stores, for Sale.</p>

<p>7th. Wholesale Purchasers of second-hand Metals, for Sale.</p>

<p>8th. Retail Purchasers of second-hand Metals, of persons in
general, for working up.</p>

<p>9th. Every Worker of second-hand Metals purchasing the same,
from persons in general, and not from Licensed Dealers.</p>

<p>10th. Purchasers of second-hand Building Materials for Sale.</p>

<p>11th. Persons keeping Draught-Carts for second-hand goods,
purchased for Sale.</p>

<p>12th. Persons keeping Hand or Truck Carts for second-hand
goods, purchased for Sale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">-550-</a></span></p>

<p>13th. Sellers of Unredeemed Pledges, otherwise than by
Auction: and also to control and inspect the conduct of
these dealers, so as if possible to confine them to the
innocent part of their Trades; and to collect and receive
the respective Licence Duties.<a name="FNanchor_174_184" id="FNanchor_174_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_184" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>
</div>

<p>IV. To grant Licences also in like manner to other Traders,
which are already under some degree of Legislative
regulations; (but which require a more efficient Control),
provided it shall be thought expedient by the Legislature to
transfer these branches to the proposed Board, as requiring
in a particular degree the superintendance of the Policy
System, viz.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1st. Pawnbrokers in Town and Country.</p>

<p>2d. Persons keeping Slaughtering-houses for Horses, and
other Animals, not for the food of Man.</p>

<p>3d. Dealers in Horses, and persons hiring, keeping at
Livery, and transferring Horses from hand to hand, with a
view to establish a check against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">-551-</a></span> Highway Robberies, and to
defeat those subtle tricks which prevail in the Sale of
Horses.</p>
</div>

<p>And also to collect the Licence and other Duties, (which
might, in respect to the transfer of Horses, be rendered
extremely productive without being felt as a burden), and to
inspect the conduct of these classes with a view to the
prevention of Frauds, and other offences.</p>

<p>V. To grant Licences in like manner to all persons (except
those employed in his Majesty's Mints), who shall erect or
set up any cutting Engine for cutting round Blanks by the
force of a Screw; or any Stamping Press, Fly, Rolling Mill,
or other instrument for Stamping, flatting, or marking
Metals, or Bank Notes; or which, with the assistance of any
Matrix, Stamp, Die, or Plate, will stamp Coins or Notes&mdash;so
as to prevent the enormous evils constantly experienced by
the Coinage of Base Money, and the counterfeiting of Bank
Notes:&mdash;A System whereby the criminal part of ingenious
Artists could be kept under the immediate view of the
Police, is so obvious in a Commercial Country, as to require
no elucidation. And the measure is the more desirable, as
the reputable part of the Artists and Manufacturers who have
occasion to keep Presses for innocent and useful purposes,
have no objection to such regulations.<a name="FNanchor_175_185" id="FNanchor_175_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_185" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">-552-</a></span></p>

<p>VI. These Commissioners, after deducting the necessary
expences, should pay into the Exchequer weekly, through the
medium of a Receiver, the whole Revenues collected by them
for Police purposes; and it is to be hoped, notwithstanding
the very low Rates of the Licence Duties proposed, that,
<i>including the Horse Police</i>, the aggregate Collection would
go very far towards easing the resources of the Country of
the expence of what the Select Committee of the House of
Commons denominate, <i>a very inefficient System of
Police</i>.<a name="FNanchor_176_186" id="FNanchor_176_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_186" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>


<p>VII. It would be the duty of the Commissioners to
superintend, with great strictness, the conduct of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">-553-</a></span>
Subordinate Officers, both in the Town and Country
Districts, and to be careful that those who were entrusted
with the collection of the Licence Duties gave proper
Security;<a name="FNanchor_177_187" id="FNanchor_177_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_187" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> and that in their conduct, in Surveying and
Watching the Movements of the different Dealers, they
manifested the greatest degree of vigilance, prudence, and
discretion.&mdash;Above all, that they were regular in their
Payments, and remittances, so as not to incur the penalties
inflicted by the proposed Act on defaulters.</p>


<p>VIII. To correspond with the Select Magistrates in every
District in the Kingdom, and not only to receive from them
useful information, relative to offences which have been
committed, and all other matters within the scope of the
Functions of these Select Magistrates; but also to give them
their advice and assistance in every case where it is found
necessary, for the purpose of the preservation of peace and
good order, and the due administration of the Laws; and
particularly as it may apply to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">-554-</a></span> those Select Magistrates
who reside near the Sea-Coasts of the Kingdom, that in all
cases of Shipwreck, measures may be pursued, and the laws
enforced, to prevent those horrid barbarities, pillage and
spoliation, which have, to the disgrace of civilized
Society, prevailed on such melancholy occasions.<a name="FNanchor_178_188" id="FNanchor_178_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_188" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>


<p>IX. To make arrangements with the Select Magistrates in the
Country, relative to the due execution of the proposed
General Police Act, with respect to the Control over the
persons Licenced, and all other Duties which may be required
under such a Legislative System.</p>

<p>X. To obtain accurate Information, by means of regular
returns from Clerks of Assize, Clerks of the Peace, Keepers
of Prisons, Houses of Correction, Penitentiary Houses, and
other places of Confinement; and to have constantly in view
the state of delinquency in the Metropolis, and in every
part of the country; preserving such accounts in registers
for the purpose of reference, as occasions might arise to
render them useful to public Justice.&mdash;To assist the acting
Magistrates in Town and Country by conveying all useful
information applicable to their local situa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">-555-</a></span>tions,
respecting the commission of crimes, and the detection of
offenders, and which might tend to the prevention of
disorders, or offences meditated against the Laws.</p>

<p>XI. To watch the proceedings of the herds of criminal
delinquents who generally leave Town every year in the month
of March, after the drawing of the English Lottery, for the
purpose of attending <i>fairs</i>, <i>races</i>, and other places of
amusement and dissipation in the country, carrying with them
quantities of <i>base Money, and EO Tables</i>, with a view to
commit frauds on the unwary&mdash;And to give notice to the
Select local Magistrates, that they and their officers may
be upon their guard in defeating the nefarious designs of
these miscreants, who are often disguised as farmers and
labourers, the better to enable them to effect their
purposes, by cheating and stealing, particularly <i>horses</i>,
to the great loss and injury of the country.</p>

<p>XII. It is recommended by the Select Committee of the House
of Commons, that the Commissioners of this Central Board
should have it in their power to distribute rewards to
Constables or others for meritorious services, through the
medium of the Magistrates of Police, and to use such other
means as should best promote the ends of Justice, and the
general utility of the Institution to the community.</p>

<p>XIII. Under the direction of the principal Secretary of
State for the Home Department, these Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">-556-</a></span>missioners should
avail themselves of the knowledge their situation would
afford them of the degree of depravity and danger attached
to the character of the different convicts; to select such
as they thought proper objects for transportation to New
South Wales; and to follow any other instructions they may
receive for &#339;conomizing this branch of the criminal
Police of the nation, so as, if possible, to reduce the
annual expence.</p>

<p>XIV. These Commissioners being authorized by the Lords of
the Treasury, might take under their management all matters
relative to the Lottery; not only with a view to a more
&#339;conomical mode of drawing the same, but also for the
purpose of rendering the Revenue productive to the State,
without the evil consequences which at present arise from it
to the morals of the lower orders of the people, and the
distresses and miseries to which its fascinating delusions
subject them.</p>

<p>XV. It would be the duty of the Board, availing itself of
the practical knowledge which may be obtained by means of a
System of general superintendence in the Police Department,
to attend closely to the operation of the whole of the
present code of penal Laws, with respect to its efficacy and
utility; and where imperfections are discovered, to suggest
from time to time such improvements as may appear useful and
beneficial to the Police, and to the Revenue.</p>

<p>XVI. The Select Committee in their Report recommend, that
the proposed Board should have power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">-557-</a></span> "to make Bye-Laws for
the regulation of such minor objects of Police as relate to
the objects of their superintendence, and to the control of
all Coaches, Chairs, Carts, Barrows, and the conduct of all
Coachmen and Chairmen, Carters, &amp;c. and the removal and
prevention of all annoyances, and the correction of all
offences against the cleanliness and quiet, and the free
passage of the streets of the Metropolis, in like manner as
is now possessed, by the Commissioners of Hackney Coaches,
and subject to the approbation of the Superior Judges."</p>

<p>XVII. To superintend the general receipts and disbursements
of the Establishment, and to report the same quarterly to
the Treasury, and to the principal Secretary of State for
the Home Department.</p>

<p>XVIII. To receive and execute the instructions of the
Treasury in all matters respecting Finance and Revenue; and
the instructions and directions of His Majesty's Secretary
of State for the Home Department in all matters of Police.</p>

<p>XIX. To establish a more correct System through the medium
of the Select Magistrates, whereby the Laws for the
prevention and punishment of offences may be more
effectually and universally carried into execution, and not
in many instances remain a dead letter, as at present, to
the great injury of the community; or be partially carried
into effect in particular parts of the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">-558-</a></span> against a
few individuals, or for mere temporary purposes.</p>

<p>XX. Finally, it will be the duty of the Board to report to
his Majesty in Council, and to Parliament (if required) the
State of the Metropolis and the Country, with respect to
criminal <i>Police</i> in all its branches, so as to bring under
the review of the Executive Government <i>the whole
criminality of the Country</i>, at a given period each year,
where it will be accurately discovered whether it increases
or diminishes.</p></div>

<p>Such are the functions apparently necessary to be assigned to the
proposed Board of Commissioners, for the purpose of accomplishing the
objects of improvement in the Police System, which have been
recommended to Parliament by the Select Committee.</p>

<p>These objects are of too much importance to the Public, to the
Security of the State, and to the peace and good order of Society, to
be lost sight of, even for one moment.</p>

<p>While the morals and habits of the lower ranks in Society are growing
progressively worse and worse&mdash;while the innocent and useful part of
the Community are daily suffering evils and inconveniences originating
from this source&mdash;while crimes multiply in all instances under the
existing systems, (the Thames Police only excepted<a name="FNanchor_179_189" id="FNanchor_179_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_189" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>) it becomes of
importance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">-559-</a></span> apply a remedy. In legislating with this view, the same
disadvantages and difficulties do not present themselves as in many
other cases, since much previous labour and investigation has been
bestowed in forming a ground-work for the proposed General Police
System.</p>

<p>Under the Sanction of his Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for
the Home Department, a Bill has been prepared, in which, while every
attention has been paid to the means of accomplishing the views of the
Select Committee, nothing can exceed the pains which have been
bestowed <i>in preserving the rights of innocence, and in divesting
power of the faculty of abuse</i>.</p>

<p>A line has been carefully drawn between the <i>noxious</i> and the
<i>blameless</i> and useful part of the community; and while the injuries
arising from the pursuits of the former are checked and restrained,
the privileges of the latter are extended and enlarged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">-560-</a></span> This, when
properly contemplated, will be found to be the <i>true essence of good
Police</i>&mdash;and this explains in the shortest compass that is possible,
the <i>ultimate object of the design</i>.</p>

<p>The Bill comprehends five divisions:&mdash;The <i>first</i> authorizes <i>the
imposition of Licence Duties on certain classes of Dealers already
enumerated</i>:&mdash;The <i>second</i> establishes a <i>Board of Police Revenue, and
explains its powers and functions</i>:&mdash;The <i>third</i> explains <i>the powers
and regulations which apply to the Licensing System</i>:&mdash;The <i>fourth</i>
relates to <i>penalties</i> and <i>procedure</i>: and the <i>fifth</i> transfers the
functions of <i>the Commissioners of Hackney Coaches and Chairs, and
Hawkers and Pedlars, to the new Establishment, and makes provision for
such Officers as may cease to be employed</i>.&mdash;While the proposed
duties, although light upon the individuals, promise to be productive
to a certain extent; the Licensing System is likely "to purge the
occupations placed under control from the imputations which are now
but too deservedly cast upon them; and to make them by gradual steps
the instruments of detection, instead of the means of concealment, of
every species of fraud and violence."<a name="FNanchor_180_190" id="FNanchor_180_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_190" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The functions of the Board, by comprehending whatever relates to the
delinquency of the country, will establish a general responsibility
which does not now exist, and which never has existed, with respect to
the evils arising from the multiplication of crimes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">-561-</a></span> while their
diminution will depend on the zeal, ability, and discretion to be
manifested by those to whom this important duty may be assigned.</p>

<p>By this establishment of a general Police System, will it become the
duty of one class of men to watch over the general delinquency of the
Metropolis, and the country;&mdash;to check its progress by lessening the
resources of the evil disposed to do injuries, and to commit acts of
violence on the peaceful subject; and gradually to lead the
<i>criminal</i>, <i>the idle</i>, and <i>the dissolute</i> members of the community
into the paths of innocence and industry.</p>

<p>The collateral aids to be derived from this System of Control over
Dealers and others of loose conduct, in pursuit of evil courses, will
give considerable strength to the Legislative measures which are in
contemplation, with respect to the <i>Police of the River Thames</i>: <i>The
frauds and plunder in the Naval and other public departments</i>:&mdash;<i>The
Coinage of base Money</i>, and the <i>fabrication of counterfeit Bank
Notes</i>.&mdash;Whatever has been contemplated for the purpose of checking
and preventing these evils cannot be complete or effectual, until the
proposed Board is established, and the Licensing System in full
action. The control of this Board is absolutely necessary to
contribute to the success of the measures proposed, and to the
security of public and private property against the present extensive
depredations. In fact the whole System is linked together, and its
energy and success will depend on the passing of the respective Laws
appli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">-562-</a></span>cable to each object of which the Police Board may not
improperly be denominated <i>the key-stone</i>.</p>

<p>It is this responsible superintendance which is to give <i>life</i>,
<i>vigour</i>, and <i>effect</i>, not only to the Laws which are in
contemplation, but to many other excellent Statutes which remain at
present as <i>a dead letter</i>.&mdash;Let it once become the duty of one body
of men to charge themselves with the execution of the Laws for the
prevention of crimes, and the detection of offences&mdash;let them be armed
with proper and apposite powers for that purpose, and the state of
Society will speedily become ameliorated and improved; a greater
degree of security will be extended to the peaceful subject, and the
blessings of civil liberty will be enlarged.</p>

<p>A new æra in the world seems to have commenced, which imperiously
calls for the adoption of such measures; not only in this country, but
all over Europe. The evil propensities incident to human nature appear
no longer restrained by the force of religion, or the influence of the
moral principle.&mdash;On these barriers powerful attacks have been made,
which have hitherto operated as curbs to the unruly passions peculiar
to vulgar life: they must therefore be strengthened by supports more
immediately applicable to the object of preserving peace and good
order.</p>

<p>The period is approaching when to the phalanx of delinquents who at
present prey upon Society, will be added multitudes of idle and
depraved characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">-563-</a></span> discharged from the Army and Navy on the return
of Peace.&mdash;Policy and humanity require that an adequate remedy should
be provided for such a contingency.&mdash;<i>Qui non vetat peccare cum
possit, jubet.</i> Where the powers of a State are not employed to avert
apparent and threatened evils, a tacit assent is given to the
commission of crimes. On the contrary, where means are used to check
the progress of turpitude and vice, and to compel obedience to the
Laws, the comfort of Society is promoted, and the privileges of
innocence are secured.</p>

<p>If in the accomplishment of the design which has been recommended by
the highest authority, these objects shall be gradually attained&mdash;If
it shall operate in preventing acts of violence and fraud from being
committed upon the peaceful subject; while means are discovered
through the medium of a well-regulated Police, whereby the
unfortunate, and even the idle and the dissolute, may possess a
resource for subsistence by honest industry, without having any
pretended plea of necessity for resorting to Crimes; great, indeed,
would be the benefits which would result to the Public. This would be
at once the triumph both of reason and humanity.</p>

<p>The first step is, to attend to the Morals and the Habits of the
rising Generation; to adapt the Laws more particularly to the manners
of the People, by minutely examining the state of Society, so as to
lead the inferior orders, as it were, insensibly into better Habits,
by gentle restraints upon those propensities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">-564-</a></span> which terminate in
Idleness and Debauchery;&mdash;to remove temptations, in their nature
productive of evil, and to establish incitements to good and useful
pursuits.</p>

<p>Among a variety of other Functions which would devolve on the proposed
Commissioners, perhaps one might be to offer suggestions to the
Executive Government, with respect to such useful Regulations as might
arise from the extensive knowledge which they must necessarily acquire
as to the condition and pursuits of the labouring People; and hence
would result one of the greatest means of preventing Crimes, and
improving the Condition of human Life.</p>

<p>But while it is acknowledged to be a vain hope to reduce the
tumultuous passions of Men to absolute regularity, so as to render the
Commission of offences impracticable; it is equally clear (and it is
even proved by the State of Society, where Public Morals have been
more effectually guarded,) that it is possible to diminish the Evil
very considerably.</p>

<p>By the establishment of a well-conducted Board of Police, a confident
hope is entertained that this purpose is attainable; and in this view
(although it is to take nothing from the present Resources of the
State), it is a blessing to the Nation, which could scarce be too
dearly purchased at any price.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the foregoing list of various laudable Institutions,
which it cannot be expected should be altogether perfect, but which
may be said to be unparalleled in point of extent, as well as
munificence, and conferring the highest honour on the National
Character for Charity and Humanity; the mind is lost in astonishment,
that greater and more extensive benefits have not arisen to the
inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">-576-</a></span> of the Metropolis; not only in improving their morals,
but in preventing the lowest orders of the People from suffering that
extreme misery and wretchedness, which has already been stated to
exist in so great a degree in London.</p>

<p>When it is also recollected, that large sums are annually expended by
Societies instituted for promoting religion, virtue, and good morals,
it must be evident, as human misery does not appear to be alleviated,
and the morals of the People grow worse&mdash;that there must be some cause
to produce effects so opposite to what might have been expected from
such unparalleled philanthropy; the cause, indeed, may easily be
traced to that evident deficiency in the general System of Police,
which has so often been mentioned in the course of this Work.<a name="FNanchor_182_192" id="FNanchor_182_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_192" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to contemplate this view of a very interesting
subject, without being forcibly struck with the vast extent of the
wealth and commercial intercourse of the Country, which furnish
advantageous employment for such a multitude of individuals in one
particular profession. Every good man, and every lover of his country,
must anxiously wish that the advantages may be reciprocal; and that
men of talents, integrity, and ability, in the profession of the Law,
while they extend their aid to the removal of those evils which are a
reproach to the criminal jurisprudence of the Country, would also
assist in procuring the removal of the inconveniences at present felt
in the recovery of small debts. This is peculiarly irksome to every
well-disposed person, who, in the course of business, having
transactions with the mass of mankind, cannot avoid frequently meeting
with bad or litigious characters, by whom disputes are unavoidably
generated.</p>

<p>According to the prevailing System, if the debt exceeds 40<i>s.</i> the
action may be brought in a superior Court, where, if contested or
defended, the expence, at the lowest computation, must be upwards of
fifty pounds. Prudent men, under such circumstances, will forego a
just claim upon another, or make up a false one upon themselves, as by
far the least of two evils, in all cases where they come in contact
with designing and bad people; and hence it is, that the worthless
part of mankind, availing themselves in <i>Civil</i> as others do in
<i>Criminal Cases</i>, of the imper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">-585-</a></span>fections of the Law, forge these
defects into a rod of oppression, either to defraud the honest part of
the Community of a just right, or to create fraudulent demands, where
no right attaches; merely because those miscreants know that an action
at Law, even for 20<i>l.</i> cannot either be prosecuted or defended,
without sinking three times the amount in Law expences; besides the
loss of time, which is still more valuable to men in business.</p>

<p>To convince the Reader that this observation is not hazarded on weak
grounds, and that the evil is so great as to cry aloud for a remedy,
it is only necessary to state, that in the County of Middlesex alone,
in the year 1793, the number of bailable writs and executions, for
debts from <i>Ten</i> to <i>Twenty</i> pounds, amounted to no less than 5,719,
and the aggregate amount of the debts sued for was the sum of
£.81,791.</p>

<p>It will scarcely be credited, <i>although it is most unquestionably
true</i>, that the mere costs of these actions, although made up, and not
defended at all, would amount to 68,728<i>l.</i>&mdash;And if defended, the
aggregate expence to recover 81,791<i>l.</i> must be&mdash;(<i>strange and
incredible as it may appear</i>), no less than 285,905<i>l.</i>! being
considerably more than three times the amount of the debts sued for.</p>

<p>The mind is lost in astonishment at the contemplation of a
circumstance, marking, in so strong a degree, the deficiency of this
important branch of the jurisprudence of the Country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">-586-</a></span></p>

<p>Through this new medium we discover one of the many causes of the
increase of crimes.&mdash;And hence that caution which men in business are
compelled to exercise (especially in the Metropolis), to avoid
transactions with those who are supposed to be devoid of principle.</p>

<p>Whenever the Laws cannot be promptly executed, at an expence, that
will not restrain the worthy and useful part of the Community from the
following up their just rights, bad men will multiply. The morals of
the People will become more and more corrupted, and the best interests
of the State will be endangered.</p>

<p>In a political as well as in a moral point of view, it is an evil that
should not be suffered to exist; especially when it can be
demonstrated, that a remedy may be applied, without affecting the
pecuniary interest of the more reputable part of the Profession of the
Law, while it would unquestionably produce a more general diffusion of
Emolument.</p>

<p>If, instead of the various inferior Courts for the recovery of debts,
(exclusive of the Courts of Conscience) which have been mentioned in
this Chapter, and which are of very limited use on account of appeals
lying in all actions above 5<i>l.</i>&mdash;the Justices, in General Sessions of
the Peace, <i>specially commissioned</i>, were to be empowered to hear and
determine <i>finally, by a Jury</i>, all actions of debt under 50<i>l.</i> and
to tax the Costs <i>in proportion to the amount of the Verdict</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">-587-</a></span> great
benefits would result to the Public. <i>At present, the rule is to allow
the same cost for forty shillings as for ten thousand
pounds!</i><a name="FNanchor_184_194" id="FNanchor_184_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_194" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>&mdash;It depends only on the length of the pleadings, and not
on the value of the action.</p>

<p>Humanity, Justice, and Policy, plead for an improvement of the System;
more particularly when it is recollected that, between <i>Six</i> and
<i>Seven Thousand</i> unfortunate persons are arrested annually on <i>mesne
process</i> in Middlesex alone, one half of whom are for debts <i>under
twenty pounds</i>. In the kingdom at large, the number is not less than
<i>Forty Thousand</i> for trifling debts in the course of a year!&mdash;The
unavoidable expence, therefore, at the lowest computation, is a most
grievous burden, which on many occasions, sends both the plaintiff and
defendant to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">-588-</a></span> gaol, for the Attorney's bills, to the total ruin of
themselves, and often to the destruction of their families.</p>

<p>The Evil, in this view, is exceedingly prominent.&mdash;It involves in it
consequences which trench upon the best interests of the Country. The
Mischief increases, unperceived by the people at large, and Remedies
are not applied; because few men will subject themselves to
investigations of great labour, without which facts are not to be
obtained; and without facts it is impossible to reason with accuracy,
or to draw just conclusions upon any subject.</p>

<p>It will be found upon inquiry, that the miseries of a gaol, by which
the inferior orders of the people are often punished, do not so
frequently attach to the worthless and profligate part of the
Community, as to those who have been useful members of the State&mdash;Like
the adroit thief, encouraged to proceed by many escapes, Knaves are
seldom victims to the severity of the Law.&mdash;The Innocent, and often
the Industrious, unskilled in the tricks and artifices which bad men
pursue to rid themselves of incumbrances, (for which there is abundant
resource in the chicane of the Law;) are generally the sufferers.</p>

<p>To incarcerate one member of the body politic, whose misfortunes and
losses may have arisen from giving credit to another, who is relieved
by a Commission of Bankrupt,<a name="FNanchor_185_195" id="FNanchor_185_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_195" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> because his debts amounted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">-589-</a></span> more
than 100<i>l.</i> seems not well to accord with Justice, Humanity, or State
Policy. It debases the minds of thousands whose conduct never deserved
such a fate&mdash;who were from the nature of their dealings, <i>although
small</i>, entitled upon the principle adopted by the Legislature, to the
same relief which is extended to the higher classes by whom they often
suffer&mdash;and sometimes too by the most worthless and depraved.&mdash;While
no good can arise from their confinement, it is thus rendered
infinitely more severe than that, which is, in many instances,
inflicted on criminal offenders.&mdash;Their labour is lost to the
Community.&mdash;Their families are neglected&mdash;and perhaps reared up in
vice and idleness to become Nuisances in that Society, of which they
might have been virtuous and useful Members.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">-590-</a></span></p>
<p>This, therefore, is a most important branch of what may be called
<i>Civil Police</i>, highly deserving the attention of the Legislature;
because it is not only contrary to Reason, but pregnant with evils
which tend to the increase of crimes in a greater degree than is
generally supposed.</p>

<p>The extensive and growing intercourse in commercial dealings, and the
diffused state of property must, of course, progressively, increase
the number of Appeals to Courts of Justice, even under the present
System; till at length the duty of the Judges (infinitely more
extensive than their predecessors experienced, and increasing every
day,) will so multiply, as to render it an act of great cruelty and
injustice, not to ease them of the unreasonable labour arising from
small Law-suits.</p>

<p>The same reasoning applies to the Members of the Executive Government.
As we advance in riches, population, and crimes, the management of the
Country becomes more complicated. The labour attached to the higher
departments of the State of all descriptions is infinitely greater
than a century ago; and yet there is no increase in the number of the
first executive responsible officers.&mdash;This, (although it has not
heretofore attracted notice), when duly considered, will be found to
be a very serious misfortune.</p>

<p>The mind, however active or enlightened, can only compass certain
objects. It requires relaxation; it cannot always be upon the
stretch.&mdash;There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">-591-</a></span> is a point beyond which human exertion cannot go&mdash;and
hence the necessity of the division of labour, in proportion to the
increase of responsible public duty. Wherever this does not take
place, the Country suffers; an unreasonable burden attaches, by which
means matters of great consequence to the Community must be
overlooked, because it is impossible to compass every thing.</p>

<p>Having thus briefly explained that branch of the Police of the Capital
which is connected with the department of the Law, together with some
of the most prominent features of abuse, which have grown out of the
present System; as well as the Remedies which have occurred, as
apparently best calculated to remove these accumulating evils. It
remains now to bring under the review of the Reader, the various
<i>Municipal Regulations</i>, which have been established for the comfort,
accommodation, and convenience of the inhabitants; and the means used
in carrying them into execution.</p>

<p>The Metropolis of the Empire having been extended so far beyond its
ancient limits;&mdash;every parish, hamlet, liberty, or precinct, now
contiguous to the Cities of <i>London</i> and <i>Westminster</i>, may be
considered as a separate Municipality, where the inhabitants regulate
the Police of their respective districts, under the authority of a
great variety of different Acts of Parliament; enabling them to raise
money for paving the streets, and to assess the householders for the
interest thereof, as well as for the annual expence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">-592-</a></span> of <i>watching,
cleansing, and removing nuisances and annoyances</i>. These funds, as
well as the execution of the powers of the different Acts, (excepting
where the interference of Magistrates is necessary) are placed in the
hands of Trustees, of whom in many instances, the Church Wardens, or
Parish Officers for the time being, are Members <i>ex officio</i>; and by
these different Bodies, all matters relative to the immediate safety,
comfort and convenience of the inhabitants are managed and regulated.</p>

<p>These Regulations, however, are mostly founded upon Statutes made in
the last and present Reign.</p>

<p>The Act of the 2d of William and Mary, cap. 8, for paving, cleansing,
&amp;c. within the City and Liberties of <i>Westminster</i>, and the Bills of
Mortality, not having been found applicable to modern improvements,
new regulations became necessary; and an incredible number of private
Statutes applicable to the different Parishes, Hamlets, and Liberties,
composing the Metropolis, have been passed within the last 50 years.</p>

<p>The Act of the 10th George II. cap. 22, established a System for
paving and lighting, cleansing, and watching the City of London: but
the Statute which removed <i>signs and sign-posts</i>, <i>balconies</i>,
<i>spouts</i>, <i>gutters</i>, and those other <i>encroachments</i> and <i>annoyances</i>,
which were felt as grievances, by the inhabitants, did not pass till
the year 1771.&mdash;The 11th of Geo. III. cap. 29, contains a complete and
masterly System of that branch of the Police which is con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">-593-</a></span>nected with
municipal regulations, and may be considered as a model for every
large City in the Empire. This excellent Act extends to every
obstruction by carts and carriages, and provides a remedy for all
nuisances, which can prove, in any respect, offensive to the
inhabitants; and special Commissioners, called <i>Commissioners of
Sewers</i>, are appointed to ensure a regular execution. It is further
improved by the 33d of his present Majesty, cap. 75, by which the
power of the Commissioners is increased, and some nuisances arising
from Butchers, Dustmen, &amp;c. further provided against.</p>

<p>In the City and Liberty of Westminster also, many useful Municipal
Regulations have been made within the present Century. The Acts of the
27th of Elizabeth, and the 16th of Charles I. (private Acts) divided
the City and Liberties into 12 Wards, and appointed 12 Burgesses to
regulate the Police of each Ward; who, with the Dean, or High Steward
of Westminster, were authorised to govern this District of the
Metropolis.</p>

<p>The Act of the 29th of George II. cap. 25, enabled the Dean, or his
High Steward, to choose 80 Constables in a Court Leet: and the same
act authorised the appointment of an Annoyance-Jury of 48 inhabitants,
to examine weights and measures; and to make presentments of every
public nuisance, either in the City or Liberty.&mdash;The Acts of the 31st
of George II. cap. 17 and 25, improved the former Statute, and allowed
a free market to be held in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">-594-</a></span> Westminster.&mdash;The Act of the 2d of George
III. cap. 21, extended and improved the System for <i>paving, cleansing,
lighting and watching</i> the City and Liberty, by including six other
adjoining Parishes and Liberties in Middlesex: This Act was afterwards
amended by the 3d of his present Majesty, cap. 23.&mdash;The Acts 5th Geo.
III. caps. 13, 50; 11th Geo. III. cap. 22; and particularly 14th Geo.
III. cap. 90, for regulating the nightly Watch and Constables, made
further improvements in the General System by which those branches of
Police in Westminster are at present regulated.</p>

<p>In the Borough of Southwark also the same System has been pursued; the
Acts 28th Geo. II. cap. 9; and 6th Geo. III. cap. 24, having
established a System of Municipal Regulations, applicable to this
District of the Metropolis; relative to <i>markets</i>, <i>hackney-coach
stands</i>, <i>paving</i>, <i>cleansing</i>, <i>lighting</i>, <i>watching</i>, <i>marking
streets</i>, and <i>numbering houses</i>, and placing the whole under the
management of Commissioners.</p>

<p>In Contemplating the great leading features of Municipal Regulation,
nothing places England in a situation so superior to most other
countries, with regard to cleanliness, as the <i>System of the Sewers</i>,
under the management of special Commissioners, in different parts of
the kingdom; introduced so early as by the Act 6th Henry VI. cap. 5,
and regulated by the Acts 6th Henry VIII. cap. 10; 23d Henry VIII.
cap. 5; and 25th Henry VIII. cap. 10.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">-595-</a></span>&mdash;afterwards improved by the 3d
and 4th Edward VI. cap. 8; 1st Mary, stat. 3, cap. 11; 13th Elizabeth,
cap. 9; 3d James I. cap. 14; and 7th Anne, cap. 10.</p>

<p>Sewers being so early introduced into the Metropolis, as well as into
other Cities and Towns, in consequence of the general System, every
offensive nuisance was removed through this medium, and the
inhabitants early accustomed to the advantages and comforts of
cleanliness.</p>

<p>Another feature, strongly marking the wisdom and attention of our
ancestors, was the introduction of <i>Water</i>, for the supply of the
Metropolis, in the reign of James I. in 1604. The improvements which
have been since made for the convenience of the inhabitants, in
extending the supplies by means of the New River, and also by the
accession of the Thames water, through the medium of the London
Bridge, Chelsea, York Buildings, Shadwell, and other water-works, it
is not necessary to detail.</p>

<p>The Act 9th Anne, cap. 23, first established the regulations with
regard to <i>Hackney Coaches</i> and <i>Chairs</i>, which have been improved and
extended by several subsequent Statutes, <i>viz.</i> 10 Anne, cap. 19; 12

<p>These Acts authorize <i>one thousand coaches</i>, and <i>four hundred hackney
chairs</i>, to be licensed for the accommodation of the inhabitants of
the Metropolis; and Magistrates, as well as the Commissioners, are
empowered to decide, in a summary way, upon all complaints arising
between Coachmen or Chairmen, and the inhabitants, who may have
occasion to employ them.</p>

<p>Carts and other carriages have also been regulated by several
different Acts, <i>viz.</i> 1 Geo. I. stat. 2. cap. 57; 18 Geo. II. cap.
33; 24 Geo. II. cap. 43; 30 Geo. II. cap. 22; 7 Geo. III. cap. 44; and
24 Geo. III. cap. 27. The Statutes contain a very complete System,
relative to this branch of Police; by virtue of which all complaints
arising from offences under these Acts, are also cognizable by the
Magistrates, in a summary way.</p>

<p>The Act of the 34th of George III. cap. 65, established an improved
System, with regard to <i>Watermen plying on the River Thames</i>.&mdash;The
Lord Mayor and Aldermen are empowered to make Rules and Orders for
their government;<a name="FNanchor_186_196" id="FNanchor_186_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_196" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> and, with the Recorder and the Justices of the
Peace of the respective Counties, and places next adjoining to the
Thames, have equal jurisdiction in all situations between Gravesend
and Windsor, to put in execution not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">-597-</a></span> only the <i>Laws</i>, but also the
Rules and Orders relative to such Watermen, which shall be sent to the
several Public Offices in the Metropolis, and to the Clerks of the
Peace of the Counties joining the Thames, within 30 days after such
Rules are made or altered. The Magistrates have power given them to
fine Watermen for extortion and misbehaviour: and, persons refusing to
pay the fares authorised by Law, may be compelled to do so, with all
charges, or be imprisoned for one month; and whoever shall give a
Waterman a fictitious name or place of abode, forfeits 5<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Offences relative to the Driving of Cattle improperly, usually termed
<i>Bullock Hunting</i>, are also determined by the Magistrates, in the same
summary way, under the authority of an Act 21st Geo. III. cap. 67; by
which every person is authorised to seize delinquents guilty of this
very dangerous offence.</p>

<p>The last great feature of useful Municipal Police which the Author
will mention, consists in the excellent regulations relative to
<i>Buildings</i>, <i>Projections</i>, and <i>Fires</i>; first adopted after the Fire
of London in 1666, and extended and improved by several Acts of
Parliament passed, from that time, down to the 14th of his present
Majesty.</p>

<p>The Act of the 14th of George III. cap. 78, which repeals the former
Acts, besides regulating the mode of building houses in future, so as
to render them <i>ornamental</i>, <i>commodious</i>, and <i>secure</i> against the
accidents of fire, established other useful rules for the preven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">-598-</a></span>tion
of this dreadful calamity; by rendering it incumbent on Churchwardens
to provide one or more engines in every parish, to be in readiness, on
the shortest notice, to extinguish fires, and also ladders to favour
escapes; And, that every facility might be afforded with regard to
water, it is also incumbent on the Churchwardens to fix stop-blocks
and fire-plugs at convenient distances, upon all the main pipes within
the parish; and to place a mark in the street where they are to be
found, and to have an instrument or key ready to open such fire-plugs,
so that the water may be accessible on the shortest possible notice.
That every thing also might be done to ensure dispatch, the person
bringing the first parish engine to any fire is entitled to 30<i>s.</i> the
second to 20<i>s.</i> and third to 10<i>s.</i> paid by the parish; excepting in
cases where chimnies are on fire, and then the expence ultimately
falls upon the person inhabiting the house or place where it
originated.</p>

<p>This excellent Statute, so salutary in its effects with regard to many
important Regulations of Police, also obliges all Beadles and
Constables, on the breaking out of any fire, to repair immediately to
the spot, with their long staves, and to protect the sufferers from
the depredation of thieves; and to assist in removing effects, and in
extinguishing the flames.</p>

<p>These outlines will explain, in some measure, by what means the System
of the Police, in most of its great features, is conducted in the
Metropolis&mdash;to which it may be necessary to add, that the Beadles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">-599-</a></span>
each Parish, are the proper persons to whom application may be made,
in the first instance, in case of any inconvenience or nuisance. The
City and Police Magistrates, in their respective Courts, if not
immediately authorized to remedy the wrong that is suffered, will
point out how it may be effected.</p>

<p>It is, however, earnestly to be wished, that (like the Building-Act
just mentioned), one general Law, comprehending the whole of the
excellent regulations made for the City of London, so far as they will
apply, could be extended to every part of the Metropolis, and its
suburbs; that a perfect uniformity might prevail, in the penalties and
punishments to be inflicted for the several Offences against the
comfort or convenience of the Inhabitants.&mdash;At present it often
happens, that an Offence in one Parish, is no act of Delinquency in
another.</p>

<p>The great object is to simplify every System as much as
possible;&mdash;complicated Establishments are always more expensive than
is necessary, and constantly liable to abuses.</p>

<p>The annual expence to the Inhabitants, in consequence of all those
Municipal Regulations just detailed, is, perhaps, higher than in any
other City in the world.&mdash;Including the Poor's-rate, it amounts, on an
average, to full 25 per cent. on the gross rental of the Metropolis;
and is supposed to exceed one million sterling a year!</p>

<p>A Superintending Police would, in many instances, correct the want of
intelligence, which is apparent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">-600-</a></span> and enlighten the local Managers in
such a manner, as not only to promote objects of &#339;conomy,
calculated to abridge and keep within bounds an enormous and growing
expence, but also to suggest improvements by which it might be
reduced, and many solid advantages be acquired by the Community.</p>

<p>It is impossible to examine, with the mind of a man of business, the
various Establishments which have become necessary for promoting the
comfort and convenience of great Societies, without lamenting, in many
instances, the unnecessary waste that prevails, and the confusion and
irregularity which often ensue, merely for want of system, judgment,
and knowledge of the subject.</p>

<p>Various, indeed, are the evils and disorders which Time engenders, in
every thing connected with the affairs of civil Society, requiring a
constant and uniform attention, <i>increasing, as the pressures
increase</i>, for the purpose of keeping them within bounds; that as much
happiness and comfort may be extended to the People as can possibly
arise from a well-regulated and energetic Police, conducted with
purity, zeal, and intelligence.</p>

<p>We are arrived at an epoch full of difficulties and dangers, producing
wonderful events, and still pregnant with consequences, in their
nature, stretching beyond the usual course of human conjecture, where
it is impossible to judge of the ultimate issue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">-601-</a></span></p>

<p>Under such circumstances, it becomes, more than ever, necessary to
make prudent arrangements for the general safety, for amending the
morals, and promoting the happiness of the People; by improved Laws,
extending protection to all, and correcting those evils, which are
felt as a burden upon the Community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">-603-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="cap">I</span>N taking a summary view of the various evils and remedies, which have
been detailed in this Work, it may be right, previously to apprize the
Reader, that in contemplating the extent and magnitude of the
aggregate depredations, which are presumed to be committed in the
course of a year, it is necessary to measure them <i>by a scale
proportioned to the unparalleled amount of moving property exposed in
transit in this great Metropolis</i>, as well as the vast and unexampled
increase of this property, within the last half century; during which
period there has certainly been an accumulation of not less than
two-thirds, in commerce as well as in manufactures.</p>

<p>It has not, perhaps, generally attracted notice, that, besides being
the Seat of the <i>Government</i>&mdash;<i>of the Law</i>,&mdash;<i>Learning</i>, and the <i>Fine
Arts</i>,&mdash;the resort of the Nobility and the Opulent from every part of
the British Empire, however distant; <span class="smcap">London</span>, from being a great
<i>depôt</i> for all the manufactures of the country, and also the goods of
foreign nations as well as East India and colonial produce, is not
only the first Commercial City at present existing, but is also one of
the greatest and most extensive Manufacturing Towns, perhaps in the
World; combining in one spot every attribute that can occasion an
assemblage of moving property, unparalleled in point of extent,
magnitude, and value in the whole Globe.&mdash;From the abstract of Imports
and Exports in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">-604-</a></span> <a href="#Page_215"><i>page</i> 215</a> of this Work, it appears that above 13,000
vessels,<a name="FNanchor_187_197" id="FNanchor_187_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_197" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> including their repeated voyages, arrive at, and depart
from, the Port of London, with merchandize, in the course of a year;
besides a vast number of river craft, employed in the trade of the
interior country, bringing and carrying away property, estimated at
above <i>Seventy Millions Sterling</i>.<a name="FNanchor_188_198" id="FNanchor_188_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_198" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>In addition to this, it is calculated, that above 40,000 waggons and
other carriages, including their repeated journies, arrive and depart
laden, in both instances, with articles of domestic, colonial, East
India and foreign merchandize; occasioning a transit of perhaps (when
cattle, grain, and provisions sent for the consumption of the
inhabitants, are included) <i>Fifty Millions more</i>. If we take into the
account the vast quantity of merchandize and moveable property of
every species deposited in the various <i>maritime magazines</i>,
<i>timber-yards</i>, <i>piece-goods' warehouses</i>, <i>shops</i>, <i>manufactories</i>,
<i>store-houses</i>, <i>public markets</i>, <i>dwelling-houses</i>, <i>inns</i>, <i>new
buildings</i>, and <i>other repositories</i>, and which pass from one place to
another, it will establish a foundation for supposing that, in this
way, property to the amount of <i>Fifty Millions</i> more at least, is
annually exposed to depredation; making a Sum of <i>One Hundred and
Seventy Millions</i>; independent of the moving articles in ships of war
and transports, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">-605-</a></span> in the different Arsenals, Dock-yards, and
Repositories in the Tower of London, and at Deptford, Woolwich,
Sheerness, and various smaller magazines, in the daily course of being
received and sent away, supposed to amount to <i>Thirty Millions</i> more;
making in the whole an aggregate sum of <i>Two Hundred Millions</i>. Thus
an immense property becomes exceedingly exposed, in all the various
ways already explained in the course of this Work; and the <i>estimated</i>
amount of the <i>annual depredations</i> hereafter enumerated under these
respective heads will cease to be a matter of surprise, if measured by
the enormous scale of property above particularized. Although it is
supposed to amount to about <i>Two Millions</i> sterling, it sinks to a
trifle, in contemplating the magnitude of the capital, <i>scarcely
reaching one per cent. on the value of property passing in transit in
the course of a year</i>.</p>

<p>It is not, therefore, so much the actual loss that is sustained (great
as it certainly is) which is to be deplored <i>as the mischief which
arises from the destruction of the morals of so numerous a body of
people; who must be directly or collaterally engaged in perpetrating
smaller offences, and in fraudulent and criminal pursuits</i>.</p>

<p>This, in a political point of view, is a consideration of a very
serious and alarming nature, infinitely worse in its consequences than
even those depredations which arise from acts of violence committed by
more atrocious offenders; the numbers of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">-606-</a></span> latter have been shewn
to be small, in comparison with other delinquents, and not to have
increased in any material degree for the last 50 years; while
<i>inferior thefts, river-plunder, pillage, embezzlement, and frauds, in
respect to public property, coining base money, forgeries under
various ramifications, cheating by means of swindling and other
criminal practices, and purchasing and dealing in stolen goods</i>, have
advanced in a degree, commensurate to the great and rapid influx of
wealth, which has arisen from the vast increase of the commerce and
manufactures of the Country, and the general accumulation of property
by British subjects in the East and West Indies, and in foreign
Countries.</p>

<p>The evils, therefore, are the more prominent, as they have become so
exceedingly diffused; and implicate in criminality numerous
individuals, of whom a very large proportion were formerly untainted
with any of that species of Delinquency, which now renders them, (for
their own sakes&mdash;for the benefit of their families&mdash;and for the
interest of public morals,) objects of peculiar attention on the part
of the Legislature, as well as the Police of the Country.</p>

<p>The habits they have acquired are, doubtless, very alarming, as in the
destruction of their own morals, they also destroy those of the rising
generation; and still more so, as the existing Laws, and the present
System of Police, have been found so totally inadequate to the Object
of Prevention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">-607-</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed it is but too evident, that nothing useful can be effected
without a variety of Regulations, such as have been suggested in
different parts of this Work. It is not, however, by the adoption of
any one <i>remedy</i> singly applied, or applied by piece-meal, but by a
combination of the whole Legislative <i>Powers</i>, <i>Regulations</i>,
<i>Establishments</i>, and <i>superintending Agencies</i> already suggested,
(and particularly by those recommended by the Select Committee of the
House of Commons <i>which may be considered as the Ground Work</i>) that
Crimes are, in any degree, to be prevented, or kept in check. And it
is not to be expected, that such Remedies can be either complete or
effectual, unless there be a sufficient Fund appropriated for the
purpose of giving vigour and energy to the General System.</p>

<p>The object is of such astonishing magnitude, and the abuses which are
meant to be corrected, are of so much consequence to the <i>State</i>, as
well as to the <i>Individual</i>, and the danger of a progressive increase
is so evidently well established by experience, that it is impossible
to look at that subject with indifference, when once it is developed
and understood.</p>

<p>It opens a wide field for doing good, to men of virtue, talents, and
abilities, who love their Country, and glory in its prosperity. Such
men will speedily perceive, that this prosperity can only be of short
duration,&mdash;if public morals are neglected,&mdash;if no check is given to
the growing depravity which prevails, and if measures are not adopted
to guard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">-608-</a></span> rising generation against the evil examples to which
they are exposed.</p>

<p>Philanthropists will also, in this volume, find abundant scope for the
exercise of that benevolence, and those efforts in the cause of
humanity, which occupy their attention, and constitute their chief
pleasure.&mdash;It is earnestly to be hoped, that it may produce an
universal desire to attain those objects, which are shewn to be so
immediately connected with the Public good.</p>

<p>For the purpose of elucidating, in some degree, the dreadful effect of
the profligacy and wickedness, which have been opened to the view of
the Reader, and occasioned the perpetration of Crimes and offences of
every species and denomination, the following Estimate has been made
up from information derived through a variety of different
channels.&mdash;It exhibits at one view, the supposed aggregate amount of
the various depredations committed in the Metropolis and its environs,
in the course of a year.</p>

<p>The intelligent reader will perceive at once, that in the nature of
things, such a calculation cannot be perfectly accurate; because there
are no precise data upon which it may be formed; but if it approaches
in any degree near the truth, (and the Author has discovered nothing
in the course of four years to alter the opinion he originally formed
in any material degree,) it will fully answer the purpose intended; by
affording many useful and important hints favourable to those
improvements which are felt to be necessary by all; though till of
late, understood by very few.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">-609-</a></span></p>

<p>It is introduced also (merely as a calculation) for the purpose of
arresting the attention of the Public, in a greater degree, and of
directing it not only to inquiries similar to those upon which the
Author has formed his conjectures; but also to the means of procuring
those improvements in the Laws, and in the System of the Police, which
have become so indispensably necessary for the security of every
individual possessing property in this great Metropolis.</p>

<p>The foregoing Estimate, grounded on the best information that can be
procured, exhibits a melancholy picture of the general depravity which
prevails; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">-614-</a></span> which is heightened in a considerable degree by the
reflection, that among the perpetrators of the crimes there
particularized, are to be numbered persons, who from their rank and
situation in life would scarcely be suspected of either committing or
conniving at frauds, for the purpose of enriching themselves at the
expence of the Nation.</p>

<p>Avarice is ever an eager, though not always a clear sighted passion;
and when gratified at the price of violating the soundest principles
of honesty and justice, a sting must remain behind, which no affluence
can banish,&mdash;no pecuniary gratification alleviate.</p>

<p>In contemplating these strong features of degraded Humanity, it cannot
escape the observant Reader, how small a part of the annual
depredations upon public and private property is to be placed to the
account of those Criminals who alone attract notice, from the force
and violence they use; and to whose charge the whole of the
inconveniences felt by the Public, is generally laid, namely, <i>common
thieves and pick-pockets; highway-men and foot-pad robbers</i>.&mdash;But for
this Estimate, it could not have been believed how large a share of
the property annually plundered, stolen, embezzled, or acquired in a
thousand different ways, by means <i>unlawful</i>, <i>unjust</i>, and <i>immoral</i>,
in this great Metropolis, is acquired by Criminals of other
descriptions; whose extensive ravages on property are the more
dangerous, in proportion to the secrecy with which they are conducted.</p>

<p>Next to the evils which are experienced by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">-615-</a></span> general corruption of
morals, and by the actual depredations upon public and private
property as now brought under the review of the Reader, by means of a
summary detail, it has been shewn, in the course of this Work, that
many pressures arise from the defects in the Laws relative to the
detection, trial, and conviction of Offenders, from the want of an
improved System respecting Constables, and particularly from the
deficiency of Jurisdiction in the City and Police Magistrates,&mdash;the
want of Funds to remunerate Officers of Justice, and to reward
Watchmen, Patroles, and Beadles, who may act meritoriously in
apprehending Delinquents; and lastly, in the trial of Criminals, for
want of a general <i>Prosecutor for the Crown</i>, to attend to the Public
interest, and to prevent those Frauds (in suborning evidence, and in
compounding Felonies,) whereby many of the most abandoned are let
loose upon Society, while those who are novices in crimes are often
punished.</p>

<p>The next stated in the class of evils is, that which arises from the
Laws as they now stand, relative to <i>Punishments</i>.&mdash;Their extreme
severity, in rendering such a multitude of Crimes capital, which
Juries can never be made to believe are of that nature, in point of
actual atrocity, has proved a very serious misfortune to the Country,
in the administration of criminal Justice.&mdash;Because the punishment is
too severe, it frequently happens that the Delinquent is sent back
upon Society, encouraged to renew his depredations upon the Public by
his having escaped (although guilty) without any chastisement at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">-616-</a></span></p>

<p>It is unquestionably true, and little doubt will be entertained by any
who attentively examine this Work, that the dread of severe
punishment, in the manner the Law is executed at present, has not the
least effect in deterring hardened Offenders from the commission of
Crimes.</p>

<p>An opinion seems to have been formed, that Crimes were to be prevented
by the severity of the punishment. That this opinion has been
erroneous seems to be proved by incontestable evidence adduced in
various parts of this Work; and elucidated by a variety of reasoning,
which it is hoped cannot fail to bring conviction to the mind of every
Reader, who will bestow time in the investigation of a subject of so
much importance to Society.</p>

<p>Last, in the enumeration of the evils detailed, are those deficiencies
and imperfections, which arise from the <i>Police System</i>; as explained
in the <a href="#CHAP_XVI">16th</a> and <a href="#CHAP_XVII">17th</a> Chapters.&mdash;A variety of inconveniences, it
appears, originate from this source; and reasons are adduced to
demonstrate that the National Security, and Prosperity, are more
dependant on a well-regulated and correct System of Police, than has
been generally supposed; and that the adoption of the Plan of Police,
explained in the <a href="#CHAP_XVIII">18th Chapter</a>, and recommended by the Select Committee
on Finance, would prove an inestimable blessing to the Country.</p>

<p>Having thus briefly glanced at the Evils, detailed in this Work, it
now becomes necessary to lay before the Reader a similar collected
view of <span class="smcap">The Remedies</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">-617-</a></span></p>

<p>In accomplishing this object, while the Author ventures to indulge a
hope that these which have been suggested, or at least a part of them,
may be brought in due time, under the consideration of the
Legislature, for the purpose of being enacted into Laws, or otherwise
carried into effect; they are now presented to the Reader under the
following heads, <i>viz.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<h3>SUMMARY VIEW<br />
<br />
<span class="msm">OF THE</span><br />
<br />
<span class="gesperrt"><i>REMEDIES PROPOSED.</i></span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> First Step to all improvements in Civil Society is that which
relates to the <i>Morals of the People</i>.&mdash;While in the higher and middle
ranks of life a vast portion of Virtue and Philanthropy is manifested,
perhaps in a greater degree than is to be found in any Country or
Nation in the World, it is much to be lamented, that among the lower
Classes a species of profligacy and improvidence prevails, which as it
applies to the Metropolis of the Empire, is certainly not exceeded in
any other Capital in Europe.&mdash;To this source may be traced the great
extent and increasing multiplication of Crimes, insensibly generating
evils calculated, ultimately, to sap the foundation of the State.</p>

<p>The grand object, therefore, must be to devise means for the purpose
of checking, and gradually preventing the evils arising from the</p>


<h4 class="bl">Corruption of Morals.</h4>

<p>To effect so valuable a purpose to the Community at large&mdash;to render
the labour of the lower orders of the people more productive to
themselves, and more beneficial to the Nation, recourse must be had to
that superintending System of <i>preventive Police</i> which has been
recommended generally by the Select Committee of the House of Commons,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">-619-</a></span> which has been particularly detailed in the <a href="#CHAP_XVIII">18th Chapter</a> of this
Treatise.</p>

<p>It is thus by giving Police its true and genuine character, and
divesting it of those judicial functions which are the province of
Magistrates alone, that a proper line will be drawn between
<i>Prevention</i>, and those proceedings which lead to <i>Punishment</i> after
an offence is actually committed. It is through this medium also that
a change is to be effected in the Morals of the People, calculated to
abridge the number of acts of delinquency, and to lead the
perpetrators gradually into the walks of innocence, sobriety, and
industry.&mdash;One of the first steps towards the attainment of these
objects will be a Systematic attention to</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Public-Houses.</span></h5>

<p>In the <a href="#CHAP_XI">eleventh Chapter</a> of this Work, the progress of the corruption
of Morals through this medium, from the Infant to the Adult, is
brought under the review of the Reader; and it is considered as of the
highest importance that general and apposite rules for the proper
conduct of those houses, now the haunts of vice and profligacy, should
be formed and recommended by a Board of Police to the Magistrates
acting in all the Licensing Divisions of the Country. The benefits
arising from an uniform and well-digested System might thus be
extended throughout the Country: and an accurate and permanent
administration of this branch of Police secured, thro' the medium of a
general <i>Center</i>, where responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">-620-</a></span> should rest, and from which
the Licensing Magistrates should receive <i>information</i>, <i>assistance</i>,
and <i>support</i>, in whatever related to the proper regulation of
Alehouses, particularly in the Metropolis and the surrounding
Counties.</p>

<p>Regular reports of the number of these Alehouses in each Licensing
District in proportion to the extent of population; and details of the
effects produced by an adherence to the general Rules which may be
prescribed, would lead to new and useful suggestions which must
ultimately give a favourable turn to the manners of the lower classes
of the people, not only with respect to the diminution of Crimes, but
also with regard to their domestic Comforts.&mdash;They would be rendered
more independent of Parochial aid; and above all, the education and
habits of the rising generation would be easily
improved&mdash;<i>Apprentices</i> thus secured against the evil examples of
which young minds are but too susceptible, would enter upon life with
dispositions differently formed, and with that sort of bias which
stimulates to industry and virtue, instead of idleness, profligacy,
and vice.&mdash;In this, as in many other instances, the happiness and
virtue of the individual are intimately combined with the best
interests of the state.</p>

<p>Such prudent and discreet regulations would have a general tendency to
make Public-houses what they were originally intended to be by the
Legislature&mdash;<i>Places of mere refreshment</i>, and not haunts of idleness
as at present.&mdash;The resource now afforded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">-621-</a></span> by them to actual
<i>Thieves</i>, <i>Burglars</i>, <i>Pickpockets</i>, <i>Highwaymen</i>, <i>Swindlers</i>,
<i>Cheats</i>, <i>Gamblers</i>, and <i>Dealers</i> in <i>Counterfeit Money</i>, would not
only be cut off, but those who have been accustomed to resort to these
Houses from the temporary want of employment:&mdash;such as persons broke
down by misfortune and indiscretion&mdash;servants out of place, and
strangers resorting to the Metropolis, would no longer be assailed by
those temptations which contribute in so great a degree to recruit the
gangs of Criminal Depredators. Nothing but a well-regulated Police,
under a proper System of Controul, can remedy those evils arising from
Public-houses, and it is earnestly to be hoped, that the Functions
proposed to be exercised by the Central Board of Police would effect
this valuable purpose.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Public Gardens.</span></h5>

<p>The corruption of Morals has been in a considerable degree promoted,
not only by the assemblage of lewd and debauched company who have of
late years crowded to Public Gardens; but also by the unrestrained
Licence which has been permitted in these places of amusement.&mdash;This
circumstance has not only called upon the Magistrates to refuse the
renewal of the Licenses to several of the Occupiers, Lessees, and
Proprietors, but it has precluded the more decent and respectable part
of the Public in the middle walks of life, from what might, under
proper regulations, be considered as an innocent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">-622-</a></span> a desirable
recreation for the Inhabitants of an overgrown Metropolis.&mdash;Most of
the remaining Public Gardens have of late years fallen into disrepute,
to the injury of the Proprietors, who, under the present deficient
System of Police, have no means of protecting themselves against the
consequences of those irregularities which operate powerfully in
diminishing the number of visitors, upon which their emolument
depends.</p>

<p>While profligate and debauched characters of both Sexes find not only
an easy access to these places of amusement, but also have permission
to insult Public Morals, by doing violence to the rules of decency and
decorum; it is evident that they must gradually cease to be desirable
as a recreation to the virtuous part of the Community; and there
appears to be no remedy but by means of <i>Police regulations</i>,
prescribing proper rules, with Officers appointed by the Central
Board, for the purpose of carrying them into effect.<a name="FNanchor_191_201" id="FNanchor_191_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_201" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Indeed, if
such places of resort were licensed only by the proposed Central
Board, it might be productive of the greatest advantages; and they
might be a fair Source of Revenue for Police purposes, to a certain
moderate extent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">-623-</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Places of Public Amusement licensed by Magistrates.</span></h5>

<p>The general concourse of loose and immoral characters of both Sexes
who frequent the Summer Exhibitions, and the irregularities which are
unavoidable under such circumstances, tend in no small degree to the
corruption of Morals; and while it is admitted that such amusements
are necessary in great Communities, it is of the utmost importance
that they should not only be regulated by the Police, with respect to
the nature of the <i>Spectacle</i> or <i>Exhibition</i>, so as clearly to
ascertain that it has no immoral tendency<a name="FNanchor_192_202" id="FNanchor_192_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_202" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>, but also that the
utmost decorum should be preserved by means of proper Officers acting
under the proposed Central Board.&mdash;This becomes the more important, as
a large proportion of the frequenters of these places of amusement are
of the middle and inferior ranks of life, and many of them very young
and susceptible of loose impressions, which renders it highly
necessary that authority should be vested only in the responsible
Board of Police, to grant or to refuse Licenses: to which a moderate
Revenue might be attached to defray the expence of a regulating
System.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Theatres.</span></h5>

<p>Without entering upon a discussion how far many of the Theatrical
Exhibitions which are brought for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">-624-</a></span>ward tend to improve, or to injure
the Morals of the People&mdash;it is, at least, evident that the
unrestrained License which is permitted to Males and Females in the
walks of Prostitution in the Lobbies, and even in the Boxes of the
Playhouses, and the indecent behaviour and unbecoming language which
is frequently uttered in the view and hearing of the respectable part
of the Community who frequent these places of resort, with the younger
branches of their families, must tend in no inconsiderable degree to
the corruption of Morals.<a name="FNanchor_193_203" id="FNanchor_193_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_203" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> It is, therefore, suggested that a
Police, applicable to this object, should be formed by the proposed
Central Board; and also for the purpose of effectually securing the
Public against the attacks and depredations of the hordes of
Pickpockets who infest the avenues of the Theatres, and have long been
a reproach to the Police of the Metropolis.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Immoral and Indecent Publications, and Prints.</span></h5>

<p>Nothing can exhibit in a stronger point of view the deficiency of the
Police System than the number of immoral Books which are published and
circulated, and the indecent Prints which are exhibited and sold in
the various streets of the Metropolis, all tending in no
inconsiderable degree to the corruption of Morals.&mdash;Let it once become
a part of the Functions of the proposed Board of Police to take
cognizance of these abuses, and they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">-625-</a></span> soon cease to convey that
poison to young minds, which ultimately leads to dissolute manners and
loose conduct in the general intercourse of life.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Ballad-Singers.</span></h5>

<p>Since it has never been possible, under the existing Laws, to suppress
the herd of Ballad-Singers which are to be found in such multitudes in
every part of the Metropolis, and, indeed, in all the large Towns in
the Kingdom: and which at present are under the controul of a very
feeble Police, which does not, and indeed cannot, restrain effectually
the immoral, and often seditious tendency of the Songs sung to the
listening multitude&mdash;Why might not this lowest cast of amusement be
turned to good purposes, tending to counteract and prevent the
corruption of Morals, which are at present generated through this
medium? Under a responsible Board of Police such an object is
certainly attainable<a name="FNanchor_194_204" id="FNanchor_194_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_204" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> and the present state of things points out
the policy and necessity of carrying it into effect.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Female Seduction.</span></h5>

<p>In contemplating the excessive evils, and the dreadful consequences
which result from Female Seduction, whether it applies to married or
single women,<a name="FNanchor_195_205" id="FNanchor_195_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_205" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> it would seem to be a matter of astonishment that
no punishment has been inflicted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">-626-</a></span> criminal Law, by which the
destroyers of innocence, and of the peace of families, could be held
up as public examples of infamy.&mdash;A corporal punishment, accompanied
with circumstances of obloquy and disgrace, is certainly not too
severe where a delinquent plunges a Female (whether married or single)
into a situation, in most instances, worse than death itself; since
when abandoned by her Seducer, she is not only exposed to the reproach
and contumely of the World, but subjected to herd with the phalanx of
Prostitutes who contribute so much to the corruption of Morals, and
where the miserable victim may be said to die, perhaps, <i>a thousand
deaths</i> before her actual dissolution.&mdash;Surely an offence producing
such dreadful consequences should, as a mean of prevention, be marked
not only as an object of <i>Criminal Punishment</i>, but of <i>pecuniary
retribution</i> to <i>the injured party</i>.&mdash;Were such a law in force, the
numerous instances of Female Seduction would be greatly diminished;
while the injured woman, under such unhappy circumstances, might,
after the Conviction of a Jury, have a fair prospect of being again
restored to her friends, and, perhaps, to Society.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Female Prostitution.</span></h5>

<p>In the <a href="#CHAP_XII">12th Chapter</a> of this Treatise,<a name="FNanchor_196_206" id="FNanchor_196_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_206" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> a general view is given of
the shocking corruption of Morals, which is generated by the vast
increase of common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">-627-</a></span> Prostitutes in the Metropolis.&mdash;It now becomes
necessary to explain the specific remedies which the Author had in
view for the purpose of lessening this enormous and afflicting evil.</p>

<p>Its magnitude, and the wrongs that result from it, are too vast and
extensive to admit of any common remedy.&mdash;The excellent Institution of
the Magdalen Hospital in the course of 40 years, has only been able to
reform or reconcile to their friends 2,217, out of 3,250 who have been
actually admitted within that period&mdash;and even some of these have
relapsed into their former errors: though others, who have been
discharged at their own request, have behaved well.</p>

<p>But when a survey is taken of the aggregate number of unhappy women
who have entered the walks of Prostitution within the last 40 years in
the Metropolis, succeeding one another perhaps, every 13 years upon an
average, it is probable that from 80 to 100,000 have passed through a
miserable life, the irreclaimable victims to this debasing turpitude,
without the means of rescuing themselves from a situation so pitiable
and calamitous.</p>

<p>The fact is, that the evil is of too great a magnitude to admit of a
cure through the medium of private benevolence.&mdash;Relief without
<i>reform</i>, and <i>reputable employment</i>, or reconciliation to relations,
will do nothing towards a diminution of the evil.&mdash;It will require an
extensive System and a corresponding expence, which can only be
compassed by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">-628-</a></span> Police applicable to this particular object, aided by
appropriate regulations.</p>

<p>After the maturest consideration of the subject, the Author ventures
to offer the following Propositions as the most likely, in the first
instance, to excite a desire in many of those unhappy women to alter
their degrading course of life, and to facilitate their introduction
into situations, where, through the medium of a reconciliation with
their friends, or otherwise, at least a considerable part might be
restored to Society who are lost at present; while, under the
regulations hereafter proposed, the streets of the Metropolis will no
longer hold out allurements to vice and debauchery, ruinous to the
Morals of youth, and disgraceful to the Police of the Metropolis.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1st. It is proposed, with a view to prevent common
Prostitutes from walking the streets to assail passengers,
and promote the Seduction of Youth, that a Select Body of
discreet Officers should be appointed, under the direction
of the Central Board, who should apprehend all who can be
clearly ascertained to be in pursuit of objects of
Prostitution.&mdash;That each should be conveyed to their
respective homes, and when the Landlord's name, or the
person to whom they pay rent or lodging, is by that means
ascertained; that such person's name and place of abode, and
the names of his or her lodgers be registered, and a penalty
of 10<i>s.</i> for the first, and an advance of 5<i>s.</i> more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">-629-</a></span> for
every additional offence, be inflicted on each hirer of
Board or Lodgings for every Female apprehended in the
Streets, upon proper proof of an overt-act leading to
Prostitution.</p>

<p>In all cases where Prostitutes refuse to discover their real
place of abode, they shall be detained in a house to be
provided for their reception until such discovery be made.</p>

<p>2d. That every male person who shall be proved to have made,
or to have accepted, overtures from any Female walking the
Streets, shall in like manner be apprehended, and shall give
security for his appearance before a Magistrate next day, or
be detained in the Watch-house, and shall, on conviction,
forfeit and pay a penalty of <i>Twenty Shillings</i>.</p>

<p>3d. That for the purpose of holding out encouragement to
that class of unfortunate Females who have been abandoned by
their Seducers, and whose minds are not yet debased by an
indiscriminate intercourse of Prostitution; and also such
others as may have friends likely to assist them, <i>Twelve</i>
or more <i>sensible and discreet Matrons</i> shall be appointed,
under the Board of Police, with a moderate Salary, and
residing (with proper accommodation) in different parts of
the Town, on whom it shall be incumbent to receive into
their houses, and to provide a temporary residence for every
unfortunate Female who may apply, for the purpose of stating
her case, with a view to a recon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">-630-</a></span>ciliation with her friends,
and to the exposure of her Seducer, as a check upon such
acts of villainy hereafter.&mdash;That it shall be the duty of
the Matron, after being mistress of the whole case, to open
a negociation with the nearest relations or friends of the
unfortunate Female, and to use every means to effect a
reconciliation; or where that is found impracticable, to
endeavour to procure her some reputable employment.</p>

<p>And as an encouragement to such Matrons, to use all
diligence in promoting the object in view, they shall be
entituled to a certain premium from the Police funds,
(independent of what private Societies of benevolent
Individuals may be induced to bestow,) for every unfortunate
Female who shall be thus rescued from the walks of
Prostitution: to be paid at the end of 12 months, in case
such Female shall then be in society with her relations, or
in some reputable employment, and shall not have relapsed
into her former course of life.&mdash;That these Matrons shall be
distinguished for talents and humanity, and shall be capable
of exercising such powers as could, in other instances, be
employed to promote reconciliation with relations and
friends; and also to devise employments by which the
unfortunate persons, <i>ad interim</i>, under their care should
be able to subsist, by taking in <i>Military Shirts</i>,
<i>Slop-work</i>, and other branches of Female labour; to procure
which, it is not doubted, but Societies of benevolent
In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">-631-</a></span>dividuals would contribute their aid, so as to secure, at
all times, the means of full employment for all the various
applicants in succession.</p>

<p>In so noble a work of humanity, especially when it is
understood that the labour of the Matrons would be
remunerated by such a moderate Salary, as might be an object
to many deserving well-educated women, little doubt can be
entertained of there being many Candidates for such
Situations, who, from having no family, would be perfectly
competent to the execution of so benevolent a design.</p>

<p>4th. That with a view to the reformation of Prostitutes who
have no relations or friends, or in cases where a
reconciliation is hopeless, and who may be disposed to
abandon their evil courses, <i>Houses of Industry</i> shall be
provided in different parts of the Town, with large Kitchens
for the purpose of preparing wholesome and nourishing food
at a cheap rate, into which all who apply for an asylum will
be received; on condition that a true and faithful account
of the various circumstances of their lives shall be given,
and that they agree not only to submit to the discipline of
the Establishment, but also to perform such labour as shall
be assigned them for their subsistence, lodging and apparel.
That these <i>Houses of Industry</i> shall also be superintended
by <i>discreet Matrons</i>, who shall receive a moderate Salary,
and a certain portion of the profit, arising from the work
done, and a premium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">-632-</a></span> for every Female restored to Society,
or to their friends by their means; and in honest employment
or living with relations, for the space of 12 months, in
addition to such other premiums as benevolent Societies of
Individuals may choose to bestow, in consequence of the
impression made on their minds of the utility of such
Establishments, and the success which may appear to attend
them.</p>

<p>5th. That all the laws now in being against Prostitution,
and against the Keepers of Brothels, shall remain in full
force; with this alteration only, that instead of proceeding
against Offenders in the latter case, by the difficult,
expensive, and circuitous mode of Presentment and
Indictment, which has heretofore proved so ineffectual, the
proceedings shall be <i>summary</i> before two Magistrates, as in
Lottery and other offences, and the Delinquents if convicted
shall be subject to immediate punishment.</p></div>

<p>These are the regulations which the Author would humbly propose, as a
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: means">mean</span> of preventing the disasters and
miseries which arise from Seduction, and of diminishing the number of
Prostitutes in this great Metropolis.&mdash;Perhaps, after the experiment
is tried of the House of Industry, it might be expedient to convert
the whole into a large Penitentiary House, where only unfortunate
women should be admitted.&mdash;The suggestions which are now offered,
appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">-633-</a></span> to be not only easy with respect to their execution, but
likely to be compassed at a moderate expence.&mdash;They are, however, to
be considered as mere outlines of a practicable design, which should
certainly precede the removal of the unfortunate Females from the
Streets, as humanity points out the necessity of offering them
asylums: since by suddenly abridging their present resources, however
iniquitous and reprehensible they may be, without such asylums, it
would certainly be the means of many of them perishing for want.</p>

<p>The object to be attained is of vast importance; but it is too
unwieldy for the efforts of private benevolence, and certainly cannot
be accomplished through any other medium than that of <i>Public
Institutions</i>, under the protection of a Superintending Police.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Menial Servants.</span></h5>

<p>Among the various evils, which, in the present state of Society, tend
to the corruption of Morals, the state and condition of Menial
Servants, Male and Female, are none of the least; particularly those
who are out of place, and who swarm in multitudes, idle and
unemployed, at all times in this great Metropolis.&mdash;This is chiefly to
be attributed to the want of those legal restraints and punishments
for improper behaviour, which apply to other classes of labourers.</p>

<p>Such regulations, independent of infinite advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">-634-</a></span> which must, in
other respects, arise to the Community, would be <i>an act of great
humanity to the Individuals</i> who compose this class; since they would
check, or in most instances prevent, those indiscretions which are the
result of being under no controul, and by restraining the influence of
ungovernable and ill-regulated passions, would produce that degree of
steadiness which is the characteristic of a good Servant; and of
course the constant disposition to shift about would not be felt,
while they would be rescued from the vices which are generated at
those intervals of idleness, when Servants, Male and Female, out of
place, are exposed to every species of Seduction, till at length, by
loss of character, they too frequently become Thieves and
Prostitutes.<a name="FNanchor_197_207" id="FNanchor_197_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_207" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>It would certainly promote in an eminent degree the cause of Morality,
if the whole Laws respecting Servants of every description were
revised, and accommodated in a greater degree to the present state of
Society. Some of them might perhaps be stript of their severity; while
the penalties or breaches of moral duty, and a refusal to fulfil a
civil contract, or Conspiracies and Associations for mischievious
purposes, ought certainly to apply to menial Servants, in the same
manner as to Servants in Husbandry, Handicrafts and Labourers. A
general exclusive Re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">-635-</a></span>gister of Servants out of place, under the
inspection of an appropriate branch of the general Police System,
would also have an excellent effect in bringing to light the evil
pursuits of bad Servants; while it operated favourably to those who
were deserving of confidence. Much might be done through this medium,
favourable both to the interest of the Master and Servants; and this
with many other benefits are to be attained, by means of a
Superintending System of Police. In no other way can it be
effected.<a name="FNanchor_198_208" id="FNanchor_198_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_208" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Lottery.</span></h5>

<p>In spite of the persevering efforts of Government, who incur a great
annual expence<a name="FNanchor_199_209" id="FNanchor_199_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_209" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> for the purpose of restraining the baneful effects
of illegal Insurances among the lower classes of the people, the evil
still continues; <i>its consequences are lamentable</i>, for the delusion
of this infatuation tends, in a very eminent degree, to the corruption
of morals, producing scenes of distress, by which thousands suddenly
descend from a state of comfort to extreme indigence.&mdash;In the <a href="#CHAP_VI">6th
Chapter</a> of this Treatise, a general view is given of the effects of
this contagion, and various remedies are proposed, which, under the
conduct of a Board of Police, would certainly be effectual; while the
Revenue drawn from the sale of Tickets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">-636-</a></span> might certainly be preserved.
In the mean time, the following are suggested as useful expedients:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1st. That in every Parish and District in the Metropolis,
Masters, and heads of Families, should sign and publish an
engagement to discharge all Servants who shall be concerned
in Insurances in the Lottery; to be printed and hung up in
every Servants' Hall and Kitchen, that none might pretend
ignorance.</p>

<p>2d. That all Members of Friendly Societies, should, by a
regulation of their own, and enforced by Parliament, be
excluded from the benefits of such Societies, on being
convicted of any concern whatever in such Insurances.<a name="FNanchor_200_210" id="FNanchor_200_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_210" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p></div>

<h5><span class="smcap">Gaming.</span></h5>

<p>The magnitude and extent of the pernicious propensity to Gaming have
at all times proved a prolific source from whence has sprung an
extensive corruption of morals. The reader is referred to the <a href="#CHAP_VI">6th
Chapter</a> of this work for details, which will fully elucidate the
baneful effects of this evil, in generating <i>Cheats, Swindlers and
Sharpers of every description</i>. For the purpose of more effectually
checking this mania, and the consequences which flow from it, it might
be expedient to extend the Laws now in being respecting Lottery
vagrants, <i>to the Proprietors or Keepers of Gaming-Houses, and also to
the Waiters, Servants and Assistants, who, on being apprehended,
should, on proper proof, be punished as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">-637-</a></span> rogues and vagabonds</i>.&mdash;It
is, however, by the operation of the General Police System, that this
and other evils are to be checked or remedied.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The lower Classes of the Jews.</span></h5>

<p>Nothing would be more desirable than the adoption of some effectual
plan, through the medium of the opulent and respectable individuals of
the Jewish persuasion, whether of the Dutch or Portuguese Synagogues,
by which the lower classes, particularly of the German Jews, might be
regularly trained to some useful employment, since their present
pursuits not only tend, in an eminent degree, to the corruption of
Morals, but also to the commission of Crimes; and under circumstances,
where the necessity of the case imperiously calls for a remedy,
Legislative regulations might be resorted to; which might not only
better the condition of this miserable class of the community, by
compelling parents to bind their children to some employment, but also
render them useful, instead of being too generally noxious members of
the Body Politic,<a name="FNanchor_201_211" id="FNanchor_201_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_211" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> from the idle and useless pursuits in which
they are engaged.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Indigence And Beggary.</span></h5>

<p>The various causes which produce Indigence in the Metropolis,
discoverable through the medium of Beggary or Idleness, tend, in an
eminent degree, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">-638-</a></span> the corruption of Morals, and the consequent
increase of Crimes.&mdash;In the <a href="#CHAP_XIII">13th Chapter</a> of this Treatise this subject
is examined, and <i>a remedy proposed</i>, through the medium of a <i>Pauper
Police</i>, for the purpose of examining into the circumstances of the
numerous class of individuals who have no parochial settlements in the
Metropolis, or perhaps in any part of England, and are, from that
circumstance, denominated <i>Casual Poor</i>.&mdash;There could not be a greater
act of humanity to these often afflicted, and sometimes oppressed
individuals, or of greater utility to the Public at large, than the
establishment of a System whereby the most deserving could be propt
up, rescued from despondency, and enabled to help themselves; while by
discriminating between the <i>virtuous</i> and <i>vicious</i> poor, a proper
line might be drawn, and the streets of the Metropolis freed from the
multitude of Beggars, without doing violence to humanity.<a name="FNanchor_202_212" id="FNanchor_202_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_212" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Various other causes might be assigned for the general corruption of
Morals, which has in so great a degree increased the calendars of
delinquency.&mdash;Among these might be mentioned <i>Smuggling</i>, or illicit
Trade; the evil examples arising from an indiscriminate <i>mixture in
Workhouses</i> and Prisons; the profligate examples of parents, and the
want of religious and moral education, so universal among the children
of the labouring people.&mdash;And the too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">-639-</a></span> frequent cohabitation without
marriage among the lowest classes of the Community. These, like other
evils, which have been more particularly detailed, are objects to
which the proposed Police System would gradually attach, and through
which preventive medium the Public are to expect those ameliorating
designs, which are to secure the privileges of innocence, and better
the condition of Society.</p>


<h4 class="bl">Prevention of Offences.<br />
<br />
<span class="msm"><i>MISDEMEANORS</i>.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Cheating And Swindling.</span></h5>

<p>The <a href="#CHAP_V">5th Chapter</a> of this Treatise developes the extensive mischiefs and
evils which arise from the phalanx of Cheats and Swindlers who infest
the Metropolis.&mdash;There appear to be two remedies, namely&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1st. To look accurately at the evil in all its branches, and
then to improve the two Statutes now in being<a name="FNanchor_203_213" id="FNanchor_203_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_213" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> by
framing an act of Parliament that would include all the
various cases which have been shown to have occurred, where
the barrier of common honesty is broken down.&mdash;These cases
are detailed from page <a href="#Page_115">115</a> to <a href="#Page_132">132</a>.</p>

<p>2d. The Establishment of a Board of Police on the plan
detailed in the <a href="#CHAP_XVIII">18th Chapter</a> of this Work, with functions
calculated to check and prevent this evil, by giving to
Police the full energy of the Law.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">-640-</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Stealing Fruit from Orchards, &amp;c.</span></h5>

<p>This offence is only punishable by the act of 43 Eliz. c. 7. by
compelling the party to refund the value of the fruit stolen, or in
default suffer the punishment of whipping, which never takes place, as
the small value of the fruit detected is always paid. It is probable
at that early period Fruit was not a species of property of much
consequence.&mdash;The case is, however, different at the present time, and
surely it would not be thought too severe to place this offence on the
same footing as stealing Cabbages, Turnips, &amp;c.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Assault and Battery.</span></h5>

<p>It would seem to be a great improvement in the Police, if Magistrates
in Petty Sessions had a power finally to determine on offences
denominated Assaults&mdash;Subject, however, to an appeal to the Quarter
Sessions.&mdash;It would even be an act of humanity to the labouring
people, who are often imprisoned from the time of the charge till the
Sessions, when a confinement of a shorter duration might atone for the
offence.&mdash;It would likewise save much trouble and expences to the
parties, and the time and attention of Courts and Juries would not be
wasted by matters extremely frivolous; but by which a certain expence
is incurred, and a loss of valuable time to the parties, who are not
seldom both in the wrong.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">-641-</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Perjury.</span></h5>

<p>This shocking offence, particularly prevalent among the inferior ranks
in Society, is to be attributed in no small degree to the want of
proper <i>solemnity</i> and previous explanation on the administration of
oaths.&mdash;Nothing can exceed the unimpressive and careless manner which
is in practice in calling upon witnesses to make <i>this solemn appeal
to the Supreme Being</i>.&mdash;It would seem highly necessary that all oaths
should be administered in the most impressive manner by the Judge, and
that a form should be devised, calculated in the greatest possible
degree, to impress upon the mind of the party a high sense of the
obligation he or she has come under to speak the truth.</p>

<p>On the whole, it may be asserted that nothing could tend to improve
the Police of the Country and the Metropolis more than a general
revision of the Laws respecting Misdemeanors, and particularly the Act
of the 17 Geo. II. cap. 5. and subsequent Acts respecting vagrants,
and rogues and vagabonds; so as to assimilate them in a greater degree
to the present state of Society, and to render their execution more
certain and beneficial to the Community.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Prevention of the Coinage of Base Money.</span></h5>

<p>In the <a href="#CHAP_VII">7th Chapter</a> of this Work, the various modes in practice, by
which the Public is defrauded by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">-642-</a></span> coining, fabricating, and
colouring of Base Money are fully developed, and specific Remedies
proposed from page <a href="#Page_195">195</a> to <a href="#Page_210">210</a>, to which the Reader is referred.</p>

<p>A confident hope is entertained, that those Remedies will speedily be
brought under the consideration of Parliament, in the form of a
Bill.&mdash;If this should be passed into a Law, and accompanied by a new
Coinage of Silver, and aided by the energy of an appropriate Police,
little doubt can be entertained of the measure being effectual in
securing the Public against the enormous evil of Counterfeit Coin.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Prevention of Pillage and Plunder on the River Thames.</span></h5>

<p>The <a href="#CHAP_VIII">8th Chapter</a> of this Treatise displays not only the immense
importance of controlling the evil habits of aquatic labourers and
others on the River Thames and in the Warehouses adjacent; but also
the advantages to be expected <i>from a general Police System</i>;
reasoning on the extensive success which has attended the partial
experiment on the same principle <i>of vigilance</i> applied to this
object.</p>

<p>The extensive benefits which are known and acknowledged to have been
derived from the <i>Marine Police</i> (even under all the disadvantages of
a <i>Crippled System</i> and <i>Deficient Powers</i>) joined to a review of the
state of the River <i>before</i> and <i>since</i> this important measure was
adopted, afford the best proof that can be adduced of its utility; and
also of the indispensable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">-643-</a></span> necessity, not only of immediately
perfecting a System, by which the Commerce and Revenue of the Port of
London have been in so great a degree secured; but also of extending
the same beneficial designs, wherever the state of things require a
similar antidote.</p>

<p>It remains only for the Legislature to pass a Bill which has been
prepared, grounded on more than a year's experience of the powers and
regulations requisite for the purpose of giving full effect and
permanency to this important Establishment, in order to secure to the
Commerce and Revenue of the River Thames, those advantages which will
arise from the Preservation of Property against the numerous and
unexampled Depredations to which it was exposed; and the Revenue of
the Crown from many frauds which arose not only from the loss of the
Duties of Customs and Excise on goods plundered, but also from an
extensive illicit trade, which has been controlled and prevented by
the known vigilance of the River Guards, particularly during the
night.</p>

<p>If to those advantages shall be added an increase of Salaries to the
inferior Officers of the Customs and Excise employed on the River, the
renovated morals and improved habits of multitudes heretofore deeply
implicated in a species of turpitude, hurtful in the extreme to the
Public interest, will become no less a matter of triumph than
advantage to the Government of the Country. Every individual
concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">-644-</a></span> in the Commerce of the Port, will rejoice to see so useful
an Institution supported and rendered permanent by that Legislative
Aid, upon which its ultimate success must in a great measure depend.</p>

<p>An evil of unexampled magnitude existed, for which an effectual remedy
has been found:&mdash;not in <i>Speculation</i>, but proved in <i>Practice</i> to
answer the purposes of <i>future security</i>.</p>

<p>Let the Legislature, therefore, avail itself of the measures which are
proposed, by which incalculable benefits will be extended both to the
<i>Commerce</i>, <i>Revenue</i>, and <i>Police</i> of the Port of London, especially
when strengthened and invigorated by a Central Board.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Prevention of Plunder of Public Stores: in Ships of War, Dock-yards,
&amp;c.</span></h5>

<p>The collateral Influence of the Marine Police System, in checking in
an eminent degree, the Embezzlements and Pillage of his Majesty's
Stores in Ships and Public Arsenals, within the limits of its
Jurisdiction, is the strongest proof which can be adduced of what may
be expected by applying a similar System to all the Dock-yards in the
Kingdom. In the <a href="#CHAP_IX">9th Chapter</a> of this Treatise, the <i>Evils</i> and the
<i>Remedies</i> are so minutely detailed as to render a reference only
necessary to pages <a href="#Page_264">264</a> to <a href="#Page_287">287</a>.&mdash;If the measures there suggested shall
be adopted by the Legislature and the Lords of the Admiralty, little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">-645-</a></span>
doubt can be entertained of complete success in securing the Public
Property (<i>unparalleled in point of extent in any nation in the
world</i>)<a name="FNanchor_204_214" id="FNanchor_204_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_214" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> against those Frauds and Depredations to which it has
heretofore been exposed to a very large amount annually.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Prevention of Crimes in general.</span></h5>

<p>It has been demonstrated in the course of this Work, that the more
atrocious offences of Highway and Footpad Robberies, Burglaries, and
other acts of Felony<a name="FNanchor_205_215" id="FNanchor_205_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_215" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> may be greatly diminished, if not nearly
annihilated by improved Laws and a responsible Agency, through the
medium of a well-regulated Board of Police to carry those Laws into
effect.</p>

<p>It must, however, be obvious to the Reader, from what has been
repeatedly stated, that it is not by any <i>single regulation</i>, nor by
any portion of civil strength, however well it may be systematized,
that this desirable object is to be effected.</p>

<p>Success in any material degree is only to be expected from a
<i>combination of the various controlling regulations which have been
proposed, with a vigorous and energetic civil force</i>, and a correct
and pointed execution of the Laws and Regulations, upon which the
Preventive System is founded.&mdash;These <i>Regulations</i> may be summed up
under the following heads:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">-646-</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1st. The adoption of eight propositions contained in the
<a href="#CHAP_X">10th Chapter</a>, pages <a href="#Page_303">303</a> to <a href="#Page_307">307</a>, relative to <i>the Receivers
of Stolen Goods, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>2d. An improved mode of granting rewards to Officers of
Justice and others, for meritorious services, in the
detection and conviction of Offenders&mdash;as elucidated and
explained in <a href="#CHAP_XIV">Chapter XIV.</a> pages <a href="#Page_390">390</a> to <a href="#Page_396">396</a>.</p>

<p>3d. An improved and modernized System, with respect to
Parochial Constables, so as to restore to the Community the
original efficacy of this useful Institution&mdash;as explained
in <a href="#CHAP_XIV">Chapter XIV.</a> pages <a href="#Page_401">401</a> to <a href="#Page_410">410</a>.</p>

<p>4th. An improved System also, with respect to Watchmen and
Patroles&mdash;with a view to render this branch of the Police
<i>efficient</i>, and to insure to the Public, that vigilance and
protection to which the expence they incur justly intitles
them.</p>

<p>5th. An extension of the Jurisdiction of the City
Magistrates, over the whole of the Metropolis and the four
adjoining Counties, and a power to Police Magistrates to
issue Search Warrants, and to follow and apprehend persons
charged with offences, who take shelter within the limits of
the City of London&mdash;as explained in <a href="#CHAP_XIV">Chapter XIV.</a> pages <a href="#Page_418">418</a>
to <a href="#Page_420">420</a>.</p>

<p>6th. The appointment of a Prosecutor for the Crown to
obviate the difficulties which occur at present in bringing
Offenders to Justice; and which is elucidated and explained
in the <a href="#CHAP_XV">15th Chapter</a>, particularly in pages <a href="#Page_426">426</a> to <a href="#Page_432">432</a>.</p>

<p>7th. The Establishment of certain general Rules and
Conditions, according to which the Royal Mercy might be
extended to Offenders, on terms beneficial to themselves and
to the Community&mdash;as explained in the <a href="#CHAP_XVI">16th Chapter</a>, pages
<a href="#Page_450">450</a> to <a href="#Page_452">452</a>.</p>

<p>8th. An improved System with respect to the Punishment of
Convicts, by means of Penitentiary Establishments,
calculated to insure the reformation of Felons, and to
render this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">-647-</a></span> class useful afterwards to the Community&mdash;as
explained in the <a href="#CHAP_XVI">16th Chapter</a>, pages <a href="#Page_481">481</a> to <a href="#Page_494">494</a>, and <a href="#Page_497">497</a> to
<a href="#Page_500">500</a>.</p>

<p>9th. General Rules laid down with respect to different modes
of Punishment, under six heads, page <a href="#Page_495">495</a> to <a href="#Page_497">497</a>, with an
immediate view to render them more useful in the Prevention
of Crimes.</p>

<p>10th. An improved System of Police, aided by competent
Funds, and an extension of the Police Establishments, under
the 32 Geo. III. (1792) to the City of London&mdash;as explained
in <a href="#CHAP_XVII">Chap. XVII.</a> pages <a href="#Page_509">509</a> and <a href="#Page_514">514</a> to <a href="#Page_523">523</a>.</p>

<p>11th. By the adoption of the General System of Police,
recommended by the Select Committee of the House of Commons,
and explained in <a href="#CHAP_XVIII">Chapter XVIII.</a>&mdash;By licensing and regulating
certain dangerous and suspicious Trades therein specified;
and by raising a Revenue for Police purposes, from persons
who shall be thus controlled.&mdash;See pages <a href="#Page_536">536</a> to <a href="#Page_546">546</a>.</p>

<p>12th. By the Establishment of a Board of Police Revenue, who
shall exercise the specific Functions detailed and explained
in <a href="#CHAP_XVIII">Chapter XVIII.</a> pages <a href="#Page_546">546</a> to <a href="#Page_559">559</a>: and finally, by an Act
of Parliament, authorising such a system, the heads of which
and the elucidating observations are also specified in pages
<a href="#Page_560">560</a> to <a href="#Page_564">564</a>.</p></div>

<p>Let these measures only be adopted by the Legislature, not by
<i>piece-meal</i>, but <i>in the gross</i>; and little doubt need be entertained
of the most beneficial effects being experienced by the innocent part
of the Community, whose privileges will be extended, in proportion as
the Licence which an imperfect Police afforded to Robberies,
Burglaries, and other acts of violence on the person and property of
the peaceful subject is abridged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">-648-</a></span></p>

<p>The General Police, and the powers of making it effectual, will then
be a charge committed to responsible Agents; whose duty it will be to
penetrate into all its mazes, and to accomplish its purposes by a
variety of Regulations, all tending to embarrass, and to render
difficult and hazardous, the pursuits and operations of
Criminals.&mdash;Experience will suggest modifications, which, aided by
competent funds, must in a short time attain that point which shall
establish <i>Security</i>.&mdash;But this is not all&mdash;Without taking large sums
(as at present) from the Revenue of the Country, the effect of the
System will unquestionably be, to add to its resources in the
diminution of the enormous expence now incurred in the punishment of
Convicts;<a name="FNanchor_206_216" id="FNanchor_206_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_216" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> and which still must continue a burden on the Finances
of the Country, until the General Police System is fully (not
partially) in activity.</p>

<p>It will collaterally extend to every thing that can improve the Morals
of the People, and better the condition of Human Life.&mdash;Its influence
will be felt by giving vigour to the Systems proposed for checking all
Misdemeanors, for securing Commercial Property, and also the Public
Stores, from embezzlement and depredation; while the offences against
the Mint Laws, under the new Regulations which are suggested, will
tend much to the prevention of that enormous evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">-649-</a></span></p>

<h4 class="bl">Amendment of the Existing Laws.</h4>

<p>When in addition to the adoption of the foregoing measures, further
improvements shall be made in the Laws now in force, or perhaps a
general consolidation of the whole Criminal Code be effected, so as to
render the System more simple, and in a greater degree applicable to
the attainment of the ends of Public Justice, great indeed will be the
blessings conferred on the Metropolis, and on the Nation at large.</p>

<p>The celebrated Lord Bacon denominated them almost two centuries ago,
when they were much less voluminous, and infinitely more simple than
at the present day&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"An heterogeneous mass, concocted too often on the spur of
the occasion, and frequently without that degree of
accuracy, which is the result of able and minute discussion,
or a due attention to the revision of the existing Laws."</p></div>

<p>But voluminous as they certainly are, many omissions are apparent,
partly arising from the causes assigned by the able Lawyer whose
strictures have been just quoted, and more particularly from the rapid
changes, which Commerce and Property have made in the state of
Society.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">-650-</a></span></p>

<p>Among these, the following have occurred to the Author as highly
deserving attention.&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1st. The Act of the 30 Geo. II. cap. 24. makes it a
transportable Misdemeanor, to obtain <i>Goods</i> or <i>Chattels</i>
by false pretences.&mdash;But as <i>Horses</i>, <i>Cattle</i>, <i>Poultry</i>,
<i>Bank Notes</i>, <i>Bills of Exchange</i>, or <i>Notes of Hand</i>,
although equally objects of Fraud, are not deemed in Law to
be <i>Goods</i> or <i>Chattels</i>, offences of equal, if not of
greater magnitude, are not within the meaning of the
Statute, and hence appears the necessity of an Amendment.</p>

<p>2d. The present Act relative to Pawnbrokers is extremely
deficient, and not only in several important points
ambiguous; but also inapplicable in a variety of instances
to the general views of the Legislature, as they regard the
security and interest of the Poor, while in others, perhaps
unnecessary and useless restrictions are imposed on the
Pawnbrokers themselves.</p>

<p>3d. As the Laws respecting Forgeries now stand&mdash;the act of
forging the Firm of a Commercial House, and obtaining goods
on the Credit of such Firm, is only punishable as a
Misdemeanor; although in this case this offence is of a
tendency <i>the most dangerous that can be conceived</i>, in a
Commercial Country, where (from the unbounded confidence
which prevails) it is so easy to obtain credit.</p>

<p>A case occurred and came under the cognizance of the Author
in 1796, where a Swindler assuming the Firm of a respectable
House in Bristol, ordered goods from Manchester to be sent
to Portsmouth, where the person (committing the Forgery)
stated, that one of the Partners meant to go to meet
them.&mdash;Two parcels of goods were obtained by this device,
and immediately sold at half the value by the Sharpers,
which led to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">-651-</a></span> discovery, and enabled the Author to guard
the unsuspecting Manufacturers in York and Lancashire,
against the injuries they were likely to sustain, by the
operation of a very complicated and artful conspiracy to rob
them of their property to a great amount.</p>

<p>4th. The Receiving of <i>Cash or Specie, Bank Notes, Bills of
Exchange, or Notes of Hand, knowing the same to be stolen</i>,
is not at present a Criminal Offence: In a Commercial
Country where such offences may be productive of much evil
to Society, Why should not the Law extend to every species
of Property in the same manner as to Goods and Chattels?</p>

<p>5th. Although Arson is considered (and justly so) as a high
Criminal Offence, yet the offence of a person setting fire
to his own house, with a view to defraud the Insurers, is
considered only <i>a simple Misdemeanor</i>, and punished as
such; and where a house at a distance from others is set on
fire so as to occasion no danger to the neighbourhood, <i>it
is not an Offence known in the Criminal Code</i>, even although
it may appear to have been done for the purpose of
defrauding the Insurers.</p>

<p>With a view to the prevention of this very atrocious crime
(of which there have been but too many instances of late
years) it would seem right that it should be <i>clearly
defined</i>; and that it would not be too severe to punish
offenders by Transportation; since in all cases, where the
fire extends to a neighbouring house the offence of Arson is
committed, and the punishment is Death.</p>

<p>6th. Much inconvenience is at present experienced from the
circuitous and expensive process of Law, which must be
resorted to for the purpose of removing bad and profligate
<i>Lodgers</i>.&mdash;In cases of small concern, where the rent does
not exceed a few shillings a week, it would be an act of
great humanity to empower Magistrates to decide in a
summary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">-652-</a></span> way.&mdash;It would check that spirit of litigation,
which is the destruction of the Labouring People.</p>

<p>7th. As a means of controlling many offences, which are
generated by an assemblage of loose and immoral characters,
who are constantly afloat in the Metropolis, <i>a General
Register of Lodging-Houses</i>, would certainly be attended
with very beneficial effects: and to use the language of the
Select Committee of the House of Commons in their 28th
Report, page 31,&mdash;would also "be a Regulation, which, if
discreetly used, might probably afford the means of
materially assisting both the Police and the Revenue."<a name="FNanchor_207_217" id="FNanchor_207_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_217" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>


<p>8th. The extensive Plunder committed on the Farmers round
the Metropolis, under the pretence of <i>Gleaning in Harvest</i>
is a very serious evil, and calls aloud for a remedy.&mdash;The
practice is pernicious and ruinous to the Morals of the
Families of the Labouring People in every part of the
Country, since through this medium children learn pilfering
habits, before they know that it is a crime.</p>

<p>A slight punishment on all who gleaned in any case previous
to a complete removal of the corn or vegetables, and on
every occasion, without first obtaining leave of the
Proprietor, would prove a very salutary Regulation&mdash;for it
appears that every Thief charged with stealing corn pretends
it was obtained by <i>Gleaning</i>.</p>

<p>9th. The existing Laws being found ineffectual in
controlling the habits, and in turning into a course of
useful industry the labour of the herds of Gypsies, who
surround the Metropolis, and commit depredations in every
part of the Country, it would be exceedingly desirable,<a name="FNanchor_208_218" id="FNanchor_208_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_218" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
both with respect to policy and humanity, to provide some
effectual Legislative Remedy, since the idle, vagrant, and
miserable life of this profligate community can be as little
desirable to themselves as it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">-653-</a></span> hurtful to the
Public.&mdash;Compelling a residence which shall be <i>stationary</i>,
and obliging them to bind out their children apprentices at
a certain age, so as to incorporate them with the mass of
the people, would certainly prove a very salutary
Regulation.</p>

<p>10th. The frauds and adulterations in the article of <i>Milk</i>
sold in the Metropolis, as detailed in the <a href="#CHAP_III">3d Chapter</a> of
this Work, pages <a href="#Page_89">89</a> to <a href="#Page_92">92</a>, seem to justify the interference
of Parliament for the purpose of placing <i>Milk Dealers</i>
under the inspection and controul of the Police: Here the
injury is not merely confined to the frauds thus practised
on the Public, but the healths of the Consumers are in some
measure endangered from the infamous devices which are
practised.</p>

<p>11th. For the purpose of saving much unnecessary expence,
and also to remove the inconvenience arising from the length
of time, which frequently elapses before persons charged
with offences, in Southwark, Greenwich, and the villages
surrounding the Metropolis, make it lawful to try offences
committed in Surry, Kent, and Essex, within five miles of
the three Bridges, at the Justice Hall of the Old Bailey,
which may be done before a Jury of the Vicinage, with great
advantages to Public Justice, and without touching on the
rights of the Accused.<a name="FNanchor_209_219" id="FNanchor_209_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_219" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>12th. To establish certain Legislative Regulations, for the
purpose of preserving the Morals of unfortunate unoffending
families, by restoring to them such parents whose
misfortunes and not their crimes, have doomed them to the
horrors of perpetual Imprisonment.&mdash;And to establish
arrangements for the improvement of what may be denominated
<i>Civil Police</i>, by adopting inferior Tribunals for
distributing Justice in all actions of Debt under 50<i>l.</i> for
the purpose of reducing the present enormous expence, and
extending relief to traders in general.<a name="FNanchor_210_220" id="FNanchor_210_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_220" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">-654-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> has the Author of this Work endeavoured to develope that infinite
variety of crimes and misfortunes, which have been long felt and
deplored as a pressure upon the innocent part of the Community.</p>

<p>In travelling over so extensive a field, where almost every step is
stained with turpitude and depravity, no little consolation is derived
from being able thus to place upon record <i>practicable Remedies</i>,
applicable to the chief part of the evils, which have been brought
under the review of the Reader.</p>

<p>Nor is it less a matter of gratification to the Writer of the
preceding pages, than it must be satisfactory to the Public at large,
to discover that the leading features of the whole improvements which
he suggested in the preceding editions of this Work, <i>have attracted
the notice, and received the sanction of the Select Committee of the
House of Commons</i>.</p>

<p>The conclusion which may naturally be drawn is, that the laborious
efforts of the Author in bringing a new and interesting subject under
the review of the Public have not been in vain; and that a confident
hope may now be entertained that his humble endeavours, for the good
of his Country, will ultimately produce arrangements <i>in the New
Science of Police</i>, calculated to secure and protect the peaceful
subject against injury, and to ameliorate the state and condition of
Civil Society, particularly in this great Metropolis, by the adoption
of such measures <i>as shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">-655-</a></span> be conducive to the more effectual
Prevention of Crimes:&mdash;by lessening the demand for Punishments:&mdash;by
diminishing the expence and alleviating the burden of
Prosecutions:&mdash;by turning the hearts and arresting the hands of evil
doers: by forewarning the unwary, and preserving the untainted in
purity</i>; thus attaching to Police its genuine preventive character,
unmixed with those judicial powers which lead to Punishment, and
properly belong to Magistracy alone.</p>

The punishment of death is a war of a whole nation against a citizen,
whose destruction is considered as necessary or useful to the public
good.&mdash;If I can demonstrate that it is neither necessary nor useful, I
shall have gained the cause of humanity.&mdash;If the experience of all
ages be not sufficient to prove that the punishment of death has never
prevented determined men from injuring society&mdash;if the example of the
Romans&mdash;if twenty years' reign of Elizabeth, Empress of Russia, be not
sufficient, let us consult human nature in proof of my assertion.
</p><p>
The death of a criminal is a terrible, but momentary spectacle; and
therefore a less efficacious method of deterring others, than the
continued example of a man deprived of his liberty, and condemned to
repair by his labour, the injury done to Society. A condition so
miserable is a much more powerful preventive than the fear of death,
which men always behold in distant obscurity.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> This observation can only apply to such voluntary
contributions as are liable to abuses, and where the poor are
permitted to dispose of the benevolence of the opulent in their own
way.&mdash;The <i>Soup-Charities</i> established in different parts of the
Metropolis are a peculiar exception, inasmuch as they contribute only
to the relief of those that are really objects of distress, while no
Public Charity heretofore instituted has been found to be liable to
fewer abuses. In a great Metropolis like London, it has been clearly
established, that in spite of every regard to prudence and &#339;conomy,
decent families will be suddenly broke down, while the habits of life
peculiar to the lower orders, and their want of the knowledge of
frugal cookery have proved a source of much real calamity; for where
nothing is laid up, every pressure arising from sickness, child-birth,
or death throws many hundreds upon the Public, who have no legal
parochial Settlement, and who but for some relief must absolutely
perish;&mdash;While the Soup-Charities hold out immediate and constant
relief to many families, who might otherwise perish with
hunger;&mdash;while this species of relief may be said to be accessible to
every indigent family in the Metropolis, no lure is held out to the
idle or profligate. It cannot be disposed of, as bread, meat, and
coals, for gin and other articles. There is therefore scarcely any
risque of deception, more especially as the applicants pay down half
the original cost on receiving it&mdash;Thus establishing the means of
discrimination between <i>real</i> and <i>pretended distress</i>. About 10,000
families, composed chiefly of persons who had not the means of
obtaining sufficient food to support nature, consisting of 50,000 men,
women, and children, were relieved by the daily distribution of Soups
at <i>Spital-Fields</i>, <i>Clerkenwell</i>, <i>St. George's Fields</i>, and
<i>Westminster</i>, during the last winter, at an expence to the
Subscribers not exceeding One Guinea for every 504 meals of rich
nourishing Soup, which those poor people received. But this is not the
only advantage which attends these Institutions, since there is every
reason to believe, that while the poor are thus frugally fed, they are
taught by example, and by circulating among them printed friendly
advices, what they never knew before&mdash;<i>The means of making a little go
far</i>, by introducing the same beneficial mode of dressing food in
their own houses. And from a minute attention to this object, the
Author has great satisfaction in stating, that from the eagerness
shewn to obtain the Soup, and the thankfulness almost universally
expressed for the benefits it conferred, there is every reason to
hope, that more good has arisen to the industrious poor from these
establishments (which are now extending themselves in the Villages and
Manufacturing Towns) than by any plan which has ever been resorted to
for relieving distress. Among the various classes of benevolent
individuals, to whom the Public have been indebted for their pecuniary
and personal aid in promoting this design the Society of <i>The Friends</i>
is peculiarly prominent. To the zeal and perseverance they have
manifested, and the valuable time they have bestowed, in giving effect
and utility to the System, is owing much of its success.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> These thefts are committed by degrees in a small way,
seldom exceeding a truss of hay or a bushel of corn by one man at one
time; and are generally of smaller articles. In some places the
stealing of gate-hooks and iron-fastnings is so common as to compel
the farmer both to hang and fasten his gates with wood. <i>Middleton.</i></p></div>

considering the difference of measures, is above 100 per cent. is a
common practice with the Retailers of this useful article to carry the
milk first home to their own houses, where it is set up for half a
day, when the cream is taken from it, at least all that comes up in
that time, and it is then sold for new milk. By which means, what is
delivered in the morning is no other than the milk of the preceding
afternoon, deprived of the cream it throws up by standing during that
time. By this means a farther considerable profit accrues to the
Retailers, and the milk is greatly reduced in point of strength and
quality. This cream, poor as it is, they again mix with flour, chalk,
and perhaps other more baneful ingredients, and yet it finds a ready
market in the Metropolis. <i>Middleton.</i></p></div>

devise and carry into effect a plan for the employment of <i>Discharged
Prisoners and Convicts</i>, who may be desirous of labouring for their
subsistence in an honest way.&mdash;It is only necessary for some men of
weight and influence to make the attempt, in order to insure the
assistance of the opulent and humane in so good and necessary a Work.
See a <a href="#CHAP_XVI">future Chapter</a> as to the present state of punishment and the
remedies proposed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> The frauds and felonies committed in the course of a
year with respect to horses exceed all credibility. Above thirty
thousand of these useful animals are said to be flayed and boiled in
the Metropolis, at the Seventeen Licensed Houses, annually, of which
about one-fourth are brought there alive, supposed chiefly to be
stolen horses. These Establishments require many additional
regulations to enforce and insure that purity of conduct, which the
Legislature had in view when the Act of the 26 Geo. 3, cap. 71, was
passed for licensing persons to slaughter horses. In the operation of
this Act is strongly evinced the inefficacy of the best laws, when
measures are not pursued to insure an accurate and chaste execution.
Wherever the vigilance of a General Police does not extend its
influence in carrying into effect all regulations of a preventive
nature, it is in vain to hope that the evil in the view of the
Legislature will be diminished.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> The depredations which are committed almost every
evening in Cheapside, and the adjacent streets leading into it,
affords strong proofs of the necessity of an improved system with
regard to watchmen and patroles.
</p><p>
Allured to that particular part of the Metropolis, from the extensive
and valuable property in <i>piece goods</i> and other portable articles
which are constantly removing to and from the different shops and
warehouses:&mdash;a multitude of thieves and pickpockets, exhibiting often
in their dress and exterior, the appearance of gentlemen and men of
business, assemble every evening in gangs, watching at the corners of
every street, ready to <i>bustle</i> and <i>rob</i>, or to <i>trip up the heels</i>
of the <i>warehouse-porters and the servants of shopkeepers carrying
goods</i>; or at the doors of warehouses, at dusk and at the time they
are locked, to be ready to seize loose parcels when unperceived; by
all which means, aided by a number of other tricks and fraudulent
pretences, they are but too successful in obtaining considerable
booty. In short, there is no device or artifice to which these
vigilant plunderers do not resort: of which an example appeared in an
instance, where almost in the twinkling of an eye, while the servants
of an eminent silk-dyer had crossed a narrow street, his horse and
cart, containing raw silk to the value of <i>twelve hundred pounds</i>,
were driven clear off. Many of these atrocious villains, are also
constantly in waiting at the inns, disguised in different ways,
personating <i>travellers, coach-office clerks, porters and coachmen</i>,
for the purpose of plundering every thing that is portable; which,
with the assistance of two or three associates if necessary, is
carried to a coach called for the purpose, and immediately conveyed to
the receiver.
</p><p>
The most adroit thieves in this line are generally <i>convicts from the
hulks, or returned transports</i>, who under pretence of having some
ostensible business, (while they carry on the trade of thieving)
generally open a <i>chandler's shop</i>, set up a <i>green-stall</i>, or get
into a <i>public-house</i>: some of these old offenders are known also to
keep livery-stables for thieves, and horses for the use of highwaymen;
thereby forming a connected chain by which these criminal people
extend and facilitate their trade; <i>nourishing</i>, <i>accommodating</i>, and
supporting one another.</p></div>

a plan of <i>Travelling Police</i>, to extend 20 miles round the

on the road at all hours; the expence to be defrayed by the produce of
a toll to be raised for the purpose. This scheme might in all
probability be much improved under the sanction of a General Police
Board, without the additional expence of the proposed toll.</p></div>

parts of the Evidence of John Shepherd, in the action alluded to.
</p><p>
"The witness saw Hazard played at the Gaming-House of the defendant,
in Leicester-street.&mdash;Every person who was three times successful,
paid the defendant a Silver Medal, which he purchased from him on
entering the house, at eight for a guinea, and he received six or
seven of these in the course of an hour for the Box Hands, as it was
called. The people who frequented this house always played for a
considerable sum. Sometimes £.20 or £.30 depended on a single throw of
the Dice. The witness remembered being once at the defendant's
Gaming-House about three or four o'clock in the morning, when a
gentleman came in very much in liquor.&mdash;He seemed to have a great deal
of money about him.&mdash;The defendant said he had not intended to play,
but now he would set to with this fellow.&mdash;He then scraped a little
wax with his finger off one of the candles and put the Dice together,
so that they came seven every way. After doing this, he dropped them
into the box and threw them out, and afterwards drew all the money
away, saying he had won it.&mdash;<i>Seven</i> was the main, and he could not
throw any thing but <i>seven</i>. The young gentleman said he had not given
him time to <i>bar</i>.&mdash;A dispute arose between the defendant and him. It
was referred to two or three persons who were round the table, and
they gave it in favour of the defendant. The gentleman said he had
lost upwards of £.70. The defendant said, <i>we have cleared him</i>. The
witness has seen a man pawn his watch and ring in several instances;
and once he saw a man pawn his coat and go away without it.
</p><p>
"After the Gaming Table was broken by the Bow-street Officers, the
defendant said it was too good a thing to be given up, and instantly
got another Table, large enough for twenty or thirty people. The
frequenters of this house used to play till day-light: and on one or
two occasions, they played all the next day. This is what the
defendant called, <i>sticking to it rarely</i>. The guests were furnished
with wine and suppers gratis, from the funds of the partnership, in
abundance. Sunday was a grand day. The witness has seen more than
forty people there at a time. The table not being sufficient for the
whole, half-a-crown used on such occasions to be given for a seat, and
those behind looked over the back of the others and betted."
</p><p>
The person above-mentioned (whose name was Smith) who pawned his coat,
corroborated the above evidence; and added, that he had seen a person
after he had lost all his money, throw off his coat and go away,
losing it also.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> In consequence of a very accurate inquiry which has been
made, and of information derived from different sources, it appears
that fraudulent Lottery Insurances have not diminished. The Offices
are numerous all over the Metropolis, and are supposed to exceed four
hundred of all descriptions; to many of which there are persons
attached, called <i>Morocco Men</i>, who go about from house to house among
their former customers, and attend in the back parlours of Public
Houses, where they are met by customers who make insurances. It is
calculated that at these offices (exclusive of what is done at the
<i>licensed</i> offices) premiums for insurance are received to the amount
of <i>eight hundred thousand pounds</i>, during the Irish Lottery, and
above <i>one million</i> during the English; upon which it is calculated
that they make from 15 to 25 per cent. profit.&mdash;This infamous
confederacy was estimated, during the English Lottery of the year
1796, to support about 2000 agents and clerks, and nearly 7500 Morocco
Men, including a considerable number of hired <i>armed Ruffians</i> and
<i>Bludgeon Men</i>: these were paid by a general association of the
Principal Proprietors of these fraudulent Establishments; who
regularly met in Committee, in a well-known public house in Oxford
Market, twice or thrice a week, during the drawing of the Lottery; for
the purpose of concerting measures to defeat the exertions of the
Magistrates, by alarming and terrifying, and even forcibly resisting,
the Officers of Justice in all instances where they could not be
bribed by pecuniary gratuities;&mdash;to effect which last purpose, neither
money nor pains were spared; and the wretched agents of these
unprincipled miscreants were, in many cases, prepared to commit
murder, had attempts been made to execute the Warrants of Magistrates;
as can be proved by incontestable evidence. It is greatly to be feared
that too much success attended these corrupt and fraudulent
proceedings, in violation and defiance of the Laws of the Kingdom.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> The regulation proposed, is this&mdash;that every member
belonging to a Friendly Society, should be <i>excluded</i> or <i>expelled</i>,
and deprived of all future benefits from the funds of that Society, on
proof of his having insured in any Lottery whatsoever, contrary to
law;&mdash;and that this rule should be general, wherever the Acts of
Parliament, relative to Friendly Societies, have taken effect.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43_43" id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> The circulation of stamped Spanish Dollars, in 1797,
gave rise to a very extensive coinage of counterfeit money of the same
species, which was generally executed in a very masterly manner, and
before the fraud was discovered vast quantities were in the hands of
many innocent members of the community. Several detections, however,
having checked the circulation, and silver bullion having fallen
greatly in price, those who were in the habit of dealing in base money
availing themselves of this circumstance, purchased Dollars in great
quantities at about 4<i>s.</i>. 2<i>d.</i> which they instantly stamped and
circulated at 4<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> and by which species of villainy large sums
of money were suddenly amassed.&mdash;One dealer in particular is said to
have made above £.5000 in six weeks. The Laws attaching no punishment
to this unforeseen offence, and the Author representing the
circumstances of the case to the Bank Directors, the whole were called
in, leaving, however, in the hands of the dealers a large surplus of
actual counterfeits,&mdash;which appears to have suggested to them the
expedient of finding a market in the British American Colonies and the
United States, where, in general, frauds are less likely to be
detected from the payments being made (particularly in the West India
islands) in dollars put up in bags containing a certain value in each.
However, they were fortunately defeated in this object by the timely
notice given, by the Author of this Treatise, to his Majesty's
Secretary of State, and the American Minister, and through these
respectable mediums commercial people were put upon their guard before
the intended fraud could be carried into effect.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_44_44" id="Footnote_44_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> A <i>Liquid Test</i> has been discovered by Mr. <span class="smcap">Alston</span>, an
eminent Manufacturer, in Birmingham, of great worth and
respectability, which cannot fail to be of the greatest use in
detecting every species of counterfeit Gold and Silver money, whether
<i>plated</i> or <i>washed</i>. This discovery is mentioned with pleasure by the
Author, as it is likely to be productive of much benefit to the
Public, in protecting the fair dealers against the frauds daily
practised upon them, in the circulation of base money.&mdash;The discovery
is instantaneous by a single touch, and the expence of the Liquid and
Apparatus is trifling.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_45_45" id="Footnote_45_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> A species of counterfeit halfpence made <i>wholly of
lead</i>, has been circulated in considerable quantities, coloured in
such a manner as even to deceive the best judges. They are generally
of the Reign of George II. and have the exact appearance of old Mint
halfpence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_46_46" id="Footnote_46_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> It is a curious fact, that although the number of Pence
which have been supplied by that admirable Artist, Mr. <span class="smcap">Boulton</span>, of
Birmingham, and which have been actually circulated amounts to Forty
Million of Pieces, making £.166,666. 12<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> sterling, and which
is equal to 4<i>d.</i> for every inhabitant in this Island, according to
the largest computation: yet the quantity of halfpence (chiefly
counterfeits) which are found in actual circulation, are at least in
the proportion of forty to one. This must ever be the case until some
expedient, such as is hereafter recommended, shall be adopted for
calling them in, and substituting in their place a new Coinage of the
full standard weight: For it is evident that the Dealers and Tradesmen
at present hoard up the penny pieces, and only circulate the
counterfeit halfpence which they receive; the nuisance therefore
remains, and the coiners are thus encouraged to continue their
nefarious practices.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> A few years ago sheet-copper was as low as 11&frac12;<i>d.</i> a
pound, and will probably be again at the same price on the return of
Peace. Indeed it has been even lower, although it has recently very
much advanced in price.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> This observation does not apply to Mr. Boulton's New
Copper Coinage; for although some feeble attempts have been made to
counterfeit it, these can never go to a great extent, from its not
being a sufficient object of profit; besides the fraud is easily
detected, since each penny weighs an exact ounce: of course the
halfpence should weigh half an ounce, and the farthings one quarter of
an ounce, when these last two denominations are brought into
circulation; as it is expected they will be.</p></div>

trade can be valued, the Estimate here given is grounded on the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> While every thing connected with the present state of
Europe, and the whole Commercial world, appears favourable for the
accomplishment of the aggrandisement of the port of London, by the
establishment of Docks (already in part adopted by the Legislature)
and by a general Warehousing System, there is no opinion more
erroneous and delusive than that which supposes that arrangements of
this kind will supersede the necessity of a Police for the protection
of the trade, and for the preservation of the public peace within
these extensive repositories.
</p><p>
In what manner are from two to three thousand labourers, who must be
frequently employed at the same time within these Docks, (and those
too of a class that have been accustomed to plunder, and are not
restrained by any sense of the turpitude of the action) to be
over-awed and controlled, if no Police shall be conceived necessary?
</p><p>
The risk would be immense to commercial property; and pillage, in
spite of the gates, and every precaution which could be taken, would
probably be as extensive as it has been from the Warehouses, or from
his Majesty's Dock Yards, where the want of an appropriate Police has
been the cause of many abuses.
</p><p>
Police as recently exemplified, is quite a new science in political
&#339;conomy, not yet perfectly understood; it operates as a restraint
of the most powerful kind upon all delinquents who would be restrained
by nothing else. To the system of vigilance which pervades the
criminal actions of labourers upon the River, joined to the imminent
danger of detection, is to be attributed the general success of the
Marine Police, in preventing depredations.
</p><p>
Wherever a proper Police attaches, good order and security will
prevail; where it does not, confusion, irregularity, outrages, and
crimes must be expected; wherever great bodies of aquatic labourers
are collected together, risk of danger from turbulent behaviour, will
be greater in proportion to the number of depraved characters, who,
from being collected in one spot, may hatch mischief, and carry it
into effect much easier in Docks than on the River. A Police only can
counteract this; and to the same preventive system will the commerce
of the Port be indebted for securing both the Docks and the Pool
against Conflagration. In fine, under every circumstance where
Property is exposed, a preventive Police must be resorted to, in order
to be secure.</p></div>

in this trade; for a large proportion are known to be men worthy of
the trust reposed in them.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_56_56" id="Footnote_56_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_56"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> In the throng season of the year at least 900 inferior
Customhouse officers, and about 300 Excisemen, are stationed on board
of ships in the Port of London, besides 82 Customhouse watermen and 36
superior Officers who do duty on the River Thames. The fair allowance
of the established Tide Officers may be from 50<i>l.</i> to 55<i>l.</i> a year.
The preferable Officers having 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day only when employed,
are supposed to receive wages for 2-3ds. of the year; while the extra
Officers, who have only 3<i>s.</i> a day, are not supposed to be employed
above half the year: and the Glutmen not more than two months in the
throngest part of the season.
</p><p>
Men in such situations having a trust committed to them of great
magnitude and importance, in the protection of a Revenue amounting to
more than Seven Millions, and receiving wages inferior to common
labourers, with pecuniary pressures upon them, arising from the wants
in many instances of large families, assailed on all hands by
temptations to connive at evil practices, as they relate both to the
Revenue and the Individual&mdash;What can be expected from them?&mdash;Humanity,
policy, and even justice pleads for an increase of salary, as the best
means of preserving their morals and increasing the Revenue. Other
Regulations through the medium of the Police System might be
established, whereby their purity might be secured, and the Revenue
eased of a considerable expence, by reducing the number employed at
present, often in promoting mischievous instead of useful purposes.</p></div>

for criminal offences upon the River Thames, and to raise a fund for
suborning evidence, and employing counsel for higher crimes, and of
paying the penalties under the Act of the 2d Geo. III. cap. 28.
commonly called the Bumboat Act; there existed a club composed of
<i>River Plunderers</i>, and <i>Lumpers</i>, <i>Coopers</i>, <i>Watermen</i>, and
<i>Receivers</i>, (denominated <i>Light-Horsemen</i>, <i>Heavy-Horsemen</i>, and
<i>Copes</i>,) from the funds of which the Law expences and the penalties
incurred by members of the fraternity were paid. By these iniquitous
means not a few notorious offenders escaped justice, while those who
were convicted of penalties for misdemeanors escaped the punishment of
imprisonment, and being thus screened from justice the culprits
(previous to the establishment of the Marine Police System) returned
to their evil practices without the least apprehension of any other
inconvenience than the payment of a fine of 40<i>s.</i> defrayed by the
Club. The New System, however, affording means of detection in the
ships where the offences were committed: what were formerly
misdemeanors are now treated as larcenies, which has operated most
powerfully in breaking up this atrocious confederacy, and in defeating
all the nefarious designs of the criminal delinquents of which it was
formed, some of whom, although apparently common labourers, resided in
handsome houses furnished in a very superior style for the rank in
life of the occupiers.
</p><p>
As a proof, among many others, of the enormous extent of the River
Plunder, the convictions for misdemeanors under the Act of the 2d Geo.
III. cap. 28. from August 1792 to August 1799, exceeded <i>two thousand
two hundred</i>; of which number about 2000 culprits paid the penalty;
partly from their own resources, but chiefly, it is believed, from the
funds of the club, amounting in all to about 4000<i>l.</i> in the course of
seven years.</p></div>

compelled to pay 40<i>l.</i> for deficient sugars plundered by Lumpers and

effect of their power in overawing delinquents, from the nature of the

estimating the savings, on an average, at 28<i>lbs.</i> of sugar per hhd.
(which is only one half of what the Committee of West India Merchants,
in their Report to a General Meeting in 1798, supposed the plunderage
might have been formerly) it appears, upon this data, that the gain to
the Planters, Merchants, and the Revenue, on a very reduced estimate
as to the actual importation may be thus stated.&mdash;</p>

<p>If credit is to be given to the general and specific proofs of the
depredations which took place before the establishment of the Marine
Police, and to the numerous documents which demonstrate the saving of
property, which has been the effect of this system of prevention, the
above estimate will not appear to be over-rated. In an importation
amounting to above £.8,000,000 sterling a year, it is not too much to
say that 1&frac12; per cent. on this sum may have been saved under a
system of such extreme vigilance, where every class of depredators
were defeated in their iniquitous designs, and deprived in a great
measure of the powers they formerly possessed, of doing mischief. The
probability is, that it has amounted to more, though the fact never
can be accurately ascertained.</p></div>

of Chips would be a great improvement, and prove the means of
correcting many gross abuses which at present prevail. In this
suggestion the Author is supported by the very able and decided
evidence of Brigadier-General Bentham, before the Select Committee of
the House of Commons on Finance, in 1798. [<i>See the 31st Report of
that Committee.</i>] On a supposition that 3000 shipwrights are employed
in the several Dock-yards at the wages of 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> with the
privilege of one bundle of chips each day, which, though not worth
more than 6<i>d.</i> to each shipwright, actually costs Government 1<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> because good and valuable timber is often cut down to make these
chips.&mdash;The following estimate will elucidate what has been stated:
and shew the benefits which Government would probably derive from the
abolition of this perquisite, even if the wages should be raised,
which are perhaps too low at present.</p>

are not to be found even among the lower classes of the labouring
People in the Metropolis, many instances of honest and virtuous Poor,
whose distresses are to be attributed to the calamity of a failure of
employment, bad health, death of Parents or Children, and other causes
which human prudence cannot prevent; and particularly where the want
of opulent Inhabitants in several of the Eastern Parishes, renders it
necessary to assess <i>Indigence</i> for the support of <i>Poverty</i>.&mdash;To
these Parishes and Hamlets the Poor resort, both from the nature of
their employments, and the impossibility of finding habitations any
where else.&mdash;They have perhaps no legal settlement where they reside,
or the funds of the Parish can afford but a very scanty and inadequate
relief. Depressed with sickness, and broke down and dispirited by
extreme poverty, the little furniture and apparel of Man, Woman, and
Child, is carried to the Pawn-broker's to obtain a scanty pittance for
the immediate support of life, until at length there does not remain
what is sufficient to cover nakedness.&mdash;In these miserable mansions
the Author has himself frequently witnessed scenes of distress, which
would rend the heart of the most unfeeling of the human species.&mdash;A
temporary and partial expedient has through the benevolence of the
Publick, been administered in the excellent institutions of
<i>Soup-houses</i>: but until the funds of the different Parishes can be
made <i>one Common Purse</i>, and an intelligent management substituted in
the place of an ignorant and incompetent superintendance, the evil
will not diminish.&mdash;To the opulent part of the Community the burden
would never be felt.&mdash;At present, where the most indigent are
assessed, the rates are double and treble those in the rich
Parishes.&mdash;It is principally to this cause, that Poverty is no where
to be found in so great a degree, cloathed in the garb of the
extremest misery and wretchedness, as in the Metropolis.&mdash;And it is to
this cause also, joined to various others explained in this Chapter,
<i>that above Twenty Thousand miserable Individuals of various classes,
rise up every morning without knowing how, or by what means they are
to be supported, during the passing day; or where, in many instances,
they are to lodge on the succeeding night</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_86_86" id="Footnote_86_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> The Author has often had occasion to witness the extreme
ignorance of the younger part of this class, when called upon to give
evidence in judicial proceedings.&mdash;Of the nature of an oath they had
not the least conception,&mdash;nor even of the existence of a Supreme
Being.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_87_87" id="Footnote_87_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87_87"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> In the course of the Author's investigations, in his
official situation as a Magistrate, he actually discovered that clubs
of apprentice-boys were harboured in Public-houses, for the purpose of
supporting their fellow-apprentices who ran away from their masters.
The means of thus indulging themselves in lewdness and debauchery was
obtained by pilfering from their Masters, and disposing of the
property at Old Iron Shops.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_88_88" id="Footnote_88_88"></a><a href="#FNanchor_88_88"><span class="label">[88]</span></a> It is to be feared that much evil arises from the want
of attention on the part of Masters among the superior classes of
Tradesmen with respect to their apprentices, who too seldom consider
the morals of their apprentices as a matter in which they have any
concern.&mdash;It is even the practice to allow apprentices a certain sum
of money weekly, for the purpose of enabling them to provide
themselves out of doors, and to prevent the trouble of boarding them
in the house. If it were possible for a Master, after exerting all his
ingenuity, to invent one mode more likely than another to ruin his
apprentices, it is by adopting this plan. If he means to subject
himself to great risques with respect to the security of his property,
he will permit his apprentice, at the age of puberty when open to
seduction, to be at large in this great Town, where he is liable to be
assailed by swindlers, cheats, and sharpers, who, availing themselves
of the inexperience of youth, may corrupt the mind, and give it a
wrong bias. The dangers arising from allowing apprentices to victual
out of doors, extend much farther than masters are generally aware of:
and they who suffer it do great injury to themselves, and even great
injustice to their apprentices, whose morals they are virtually, at
least, bound to preserve pure. This is not to be expected where
apprentices are not under the eye of the master at Meal-times. Their
Sundays, in such cases, are their own, which they waste in idleness,
not seldom in water-parties on the River, where they are introduced
into low and bad company, which gives frequently a taint to their
manners of the most injurious nature. The result is, that their
master, without reflecting that he himself was the cause of their
idleness, withdraws his confidence, and turns them adrift after their
time expires, if not before; and in the end ruin, as might well be
expected, inevitably ensues.</p></div>

Synagogue are generally opulent and respectable, and hold no community
with the others; they use a different Liturgy and their language is
even different; their number does not exceed three thousand; they
never intermarry with the Jews of the Dutch Synagogue.&mdash;They generally
pride themselves on their Ancestry, and give their Children the best
education which can be obtained in the countries where they
reside.&mdash;While the Dutch Jews (or rather <i>the German Dutch Jews</i>) get
no education at all. Even the most affluent of them are said to be
generally unable either to read or write the language of the country
which gave them birth.&mdash;They confine themselves to a Bastard or vulgar
Hebrew which has little analogy to the original. The Portuguese
Synagogue has been established in England ever since the
Usurpation.&mdash;Their place of worship is in Bevis Marks.&mdash;The Members of
it being mostly wealthy are extremely attentive to their poor, among
whom there is said not to be a single beggar or itinerant.&mdash;The
Brokers upon the Exchange of the Jewish Persuasion, are all or chiefly
of the Portuguese Synagogue. Their number is limited to <i>Twelve</i> by a
particular Act of Parliament.&mdash;Originally this privilege was given
gratis by the Lord Mayor, but afterwards 100<i>l.</i> was required, which
has gradually increased to <i>One Thousand Guineas for each Broker</i>.

The schism between the two classes of Jews prevail all over the world,

The German Dutch Jews, who may amount to from twelve to fifteen
thousand have Six Synagogues, the principal of which are in <i>Duke's
Place, Leadenhall Street</i>, and <i>Church Row, Fenchurch Street</i>. They

include the <i>Polish</i>, <i>Russian</i>, and <i>Turkish Jews</i>, established in
London.&mdash;With the exception of three or four wealthy Individuals, and
as many Families who are in trade on the Royal Exchange, they are in
general a very indigent class of people, through whose medium crimes
are generated to a considerable extent.&mdash;Their Community is too poor
to afford them adequate relief, whence they have resorted to the
expedient of lending them small sums of money at interest to trade
upon, which is required to be repaid monthly or weekly, as the case
may be. Otherwise they forfeit all claim to this aid.&mdash;The reproach
arising from their evil practices and idleness, is said to have
engaged the attention of the respectable part of both Synagogues with
a view to a remedy, but all their attempts have been heretofore
unsuccessful.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_91_91" id="Footnote_91_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91_91"><span class="label">[91]</span></a> It is a curious and important fact, that during the
period when Distilleries were stopped in 1796 and 1797, although
Bread, and every necessary of life was considerably higher than during
the preceding year, the Poor in that quarter of the Town where the
chief part reside were apparently more comfortable, paid their rents
more regularly, and were better fed than at any period for some years
before;&mdash;even although they had not the benefit of the extensive
charities which were distributed in 1795. This can only be accounted
for by their being denied the indulgence of Gin, which had become in a
great measure inaccessible from its very high price. It may fairly be
concluded, that the money formerly spent in this imprudent manner had
been applied in the purchase of provisions and other necessaries to
the amount of some hundred thousand pounds.&mdash;The effects of their
being deprived of this baneful Liquor was also evident in their more
orderly conduct.&mdash;Quarrels and assaults were less frequent, and they
resorted seldomer to the Pawnbrokers' shops: and yet during the chief
part of this period Bread was 15<i>d.</i> the Quartern Loaf, and Meat
higher than the preceding year, particularly Pork, which arose in part
from the stoppage of the Distilleries; but chiefly from the scarcity
of Grain.</p></div>

the direction of <i>Mathew Martin, Esq.</i> assisted by one or two
philanthropic individuals, for inquiring into cases and causes of
distress.&mdash;The generality of the poor persons have been invited to the
office by the distribution of tickets, directing them when and where
they are to apply. On such occasions a small relief has been afforded,
arising from a fund constituted by private benevolence;&mdash;but the chief
advantage which these poor people have derived has been from the
consolatory advice given them, and still more from the assistance
afforded by the indefatigable industry, and laudable zeal of Mr.
Martin, in getting those into workhouses who have parochial
settlements in the Metropolis, or assisting in procuring the means of
passing them to their parishes, where such settlements are in the
country. Seasonable pecuniary relief has been also extended in certain
cases, and small loans of money, made to enable those who are able to
work to redeem their apparel, and tools to rescue them from
despondence, and to help themselves by their own labour, in such
employments as they could either themselves obtain, or as could be
procured for them.
</p><p>
From the beginning of the year 1796 to the end of the year 1797, Mr.
Martin investigated the cases of 120 poor persons, who attended him in
consequence of the tickets which were distributed.&mdash;Of these 21 were
men; the greater part maimed or disabled by age or sickness, only two
of whom had any legal settlement in London.&mdash;Of the women, 99 in
number, 48 were widows, about one-third were aged&mdash;some crippled, and
others distressed for want of work, while many were embarrassed by
ignorance of the mode of obtaining parochial relief, or by the fear of
applying for it&mdash;of the wives, in most cases, the difficulty arose
from want of work or incapacity of doing it, on account of a child in
arms. There were cases of very great distress. Above half had two or
more children. Some of them infants, and the chief part too young to
work. Of the women 24 claimed settlements in London and
Westminster&mdash;33 in different parts of England&mdash;22 belonged to Scotland
and Ireland, and the remaining 20 said they could give no account of
their place of settlement. In most instances by an application to
their parishes, and in some to their friends, Mr. Martin was enabled
to obtain effectual relief to all of them; the gift of a little food,
and hearing their melancholy story, afforded some comfort; and had a
small fund been appropriated to this object, it might have been
possible to have enabled those who were in health to have earned a
livelihood. See 12th Report of the <i>Society for bettering the
Condition of the Poor</i>.</p></div>

means of small Robberies, afraid of the trouble and expence of a
prosecution, submit to the loss without inquiry; while others from
being strangers to the laws, and to the proper mode of application,
fall into the same mistake; this, by proving a great encouragement to
thieves of every class, is of course an injury to the Public.&mdash;In all
cases where robberies are committed, the parties sustaining the loss
have only to inquire for the nearest Public Office, and apply there,
and state the case to the sitting Magistrates, who will point out the
proper mode of detection; every assistance through the medium of
constables, will then be given for the purpose of recovering the
property and apprehending the offenders.&mdash;The same assistance will be
afforded by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, sitting at the Mansion-house

the City of London.</p></div>

robberies were committed, to make a composition of the felony, by
advertising a reward to any person who would bring the property
stolen, to be paid without asking any questions; but the pernicious
consequences of recovering goods in this way from the encouragement
such advertisements held out to thieves and robbers of every
description, became so glaring and obvious, that an Act passed the
25th year of George II. cap. 36. <i>inflicting a penalty of 50l. on
any person</i> (including the printer and publisher) <i>who shall publicly
advertise a reward for the return of stolen goods with "no questions

necessary to consider the Metropolis as a <i>great Whole</i>, and to

witnesses are to be paid; and also (if the parties shall appear to be
in poor circumstances) a reasonable allowance made for trouble and
loss of time; but this is connected with the regulations of the
Justices, confirmed by one of the Judges of Assize, which vary
according to local circumstances, and it is also necessary to plead
poverty in order to be remunerated for loss of time: <i>but as the poor
seldom suffer by thieves</i>, these Acts appear to have had little effect
in encouraging prosecutors to come forward; and it is believed few
applications are made excepting in cases of real poverty.&mdash;In the
County of Middlesex there is an exception; where witnesses are
directed to be paid by the Overseers of the Poor of the Parish, where
the person was apprehended; but this mode of payment is seldom if ever
adopted.&mdash;The fund, however, which the Legislature has thus provided,

August 1792; where a Jew was ordered to take his trial for a rape,
committed on a married woman.&mdash;The offence appeared, on examination,
to be extremely aggravated.&mdash;The Grand Jury however did not find a
bill; which was thought a very singular circumstance, as the proof had
been so clear before the Magistrate. The reasons were afterwards
sufficiently explained; which show, what corrupt practices, artifices,
and frauds will be used to defeat the ends of justice:&mdash;In consequence
of a previous undertaking between the Jew and the husband of the woman
who had been so grossly abused, a sum of £.20 was left in the hands of
a publican, which the prosecutor was to receive if the bill was not
found. In this confidence the woman gave a different evidence from
that which she had given before the Magistrate. The Jew, however,
cheated both the husband and the wife; for he no sooner discovered
that he was safe, than he demanded the money of the publican and
laughed at the prosecutor.</p></div>

under infinite obligations)&mdash;manifested, half a century ago, how much
he was impressed with the injuries arising from frequent

Fielding, will sincerely lament that their excellent ideas, and
accurate and extensive knowledge upon every subject connected with the
Police of the Metropolis, and of the means of preventing crimes, were
not rendered more useful to the Public. It is to be hoped, however,
that it is not yet too late, since the state of Society, and the

execution; but it is to be lamented, that crimes have been by no means
diminished. The fact is, that the System is erroneous&mdash;Responsibility
is no where established.&mdash;No uniformity of System prevails, and no
general superintendance or center point exists.&mdash;Like the Poor Laws,
the only part of the Act which is rigidly carried into execution is
raising a fund, which, without imputing blame to Magistrates (for the
error is in the System), has increased the expence of this branch of
the Police of the Country very far beyond what could have been
conceived&mdash;and it now becomes a heavy burden upon many of the
Counties.&mdash;The reform began at the wrong end.&mdash;The same expence
applied in establishing a System of Preventive Police, ought to render
numerous penitentiary houses in a great measure unnecessary.</p></div>

Finance, in their 28th Report (already repeatedly quoted), appear to
be very strongly impressed with the necessity of Police Magistrates,
and a Concurrent Jurisdiction for the City of London.&mdash;They express
themselves in the following words: "It is further to be stated, that a
considerable defect is felt in the Police of the Metropolis, from the
limited jurisdiction of the present Magistrates in every part of it,
and from the want of an Institution similar to that of the Police
Offices to be established in the City of London, as was originally
intended and proposed: that the delay which necessarily takes place in
obtaining the sanction of the local Magistracy in either case, to the
warrants of those presiding in other districts, operates in all cases
to the advantage of offenders against the Laws, and to the obstruction
of Public Justice: add to which, that the numerous and important
avocations, both public and private, of the truly respectable
Magistracy of the City, is too often inconsistent with that constant
and unremitting attention which the due preservation of the Police of
the Metropolis requires. That it would be unfortunate indeed if any
local jealousy founded upon no just grounds, though entertained by
honourable minds, should continue to deprive even the Inhabitants of
the City itself, as well as those of the rest of the Metropolis, of
that security which a more permanent attendance, and a perfect
intercommunity of Jurisdiction in Criminal matters between the
Magistrates of every part of the Metropolis, and of the five adjoining
Counties, could not fail to produce."&mdash;See p. 13, 28th Report, 26th of

representing the great body of the Manufacturers in Spitalfields,
waited on His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home
Department, with an Address of Thanks for the Establishment of the
Police System; the substance of which is as follows:
</p><p>
"That it is the opinion of this Society, that great benefits have
arisen, with regard to the security of property, from the correct and
regular manner in which the judicial business has been conducted by
the Magistrates of Police; in consequence of whose vigilance and
attention, an effectual check has been given to a System of
depredation which heretofore occasioned a loss of many thousands per
annum to the Silk Manufacturers:"&mdash;And it was Resolved,&mdash;"That the
Thanks of this Society are due to the Right Honourable Henry Dundas,
one of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State; and also to Mr.
Burton, and the other Members of Parliament, who proposed and
supported the Police System, for the share they had in the
establishment of a judicial Tribunal, which has been found to extend,
to the Silk Manufacturers, many advantages in a just and proper
execution of the Laws which were not heretofore experienced."</p></div>

associated Corps, who have so nobly stood forth in the hour of danger
to support the deficient Police of the Country.

To these Patriotic individuals, the inhabitants of the Metropolis are
under infinite obligations.
</p><p>
Regardless of their own <i>ease</i>, <i>convenience</i>, <i>interest</i>, or <i>personal

stood forward in the hour of tumult and disorder gratuitously, and at
their own expence, for the protection of their Fellow-citizens, and
for the preservation of the Public peace.
</p><p>
The assistance they have, on every occasion, afforded the civil power,
and the sacrifices of valuable time which they have made, at the risk
of health, and under circumstances where they were compelled to forego
that ease and comfort, which, in many instances, from their opulence
and rank in life, are attached to their particular situations&mdash;it is
to be hoped will never be forgotten by a grateful Public.</p></div>

certain class could be brought under similar regulations, it
would prove extremely beneficial, inasmuch as the small
Manufacturers in this line are known to give considerable
facilities to the Stealers of Hemp on the River Thames.&mdash;A
number of small Rope and Twine Manufacturers have undersold
the fair trader, by working up Stolen Hemp, purchased at
half price; and it is but too evident from discoveries which
have recently been made, that this evil has gone to a very
great extent, and that considerable benefits would be
derived to the Public, by placing <i>Twine and White Rope</i>

satisfaction in stating that a Bill is now nearly prepared,
grounded chiefly on his suggestions, for improving the
Coinage Laws; and that sanguine hopes are entertained of its
passing during the present Session of Parliament.&mdash;The
proposition now made of bringing this feature of Police, so
far as relates to <i>Presses</i>, and other <i>Machinery</i>, under
the inspection of the proposed <i>Central Board</i>, will
certainly have a powerful effect in deterring evil-minded
persons from following the Trade of Coiners of Base Money,
or Engravers and Stampers of forged Bank Notes.&mdash;In this
kind of Control, the Police Revenue Board would have an
advantage arising from the nature of the System, which may
be considered as <i>invaluable in a national point of view</i>,
since no part of the Country, however remote, could be said
to be out of their reach, as Officers, under their immediate
direction, would be found every where.</p></div>

apparently, be to consolidate in one person the office of
<i>Constable</i> and <i>Collector of the Licence Duties</i> in the
respective Districts; having it understood that the poundage
received on the money paid to the Board, should not only be
considered as a remuneration for the Collection, but also as
a reward for occasional Services in the general Police
Department.&mdash;By such an arrangement, a chain of Select and
reputable Officers may be established all over the Country,
without being felt as a burden of any kind on the Community;
while those Services under the general arrangements of the
Board, could not fail to be productive of infinite benefits
in the well-ordering of Society.</p></div>

the utility of a Police Institution, such as has been recommended by
the Select Committee on Finance, than the effect of the Marine Police
Establishment upon the River Thames; where, in spite of a crippled
System, and deficient Laws, the energy of the superintendence, and the
strength of the Civil force, has, at a very trifling expence, applied
with strict &#339;conomy, worked such a change in the Port of London,
both with respect to the security of commercial property, and the
Revenue, as would scarcely have been conceived possible. For an
Account of this System, see the <a href="#CHAP_VIII">8th Chapter</a> of this Work: but for a
more enlarged and comprehensive view of the nature and effect of the
design, recourse must be had to the Author's <i>Treatise on the Commerce
and Police of the River Thames, &amp;c.</i> now in the press; in which the
whole plan is developed, together with the Legislative System
necessary to give permanent effect to the design.</p></div>

effectual remedy is applied.&mdash;See <a href="#CHAP_XIII">Chapter 13th</a>, where a remedy is
proposed.</p></div>

there being no distinction between the amount of the sum to be
recovered in one action and another, in settling the costs. In the

debts stood thus:</p>

<p class="tp">Thus it appears, that upwards of one million of money, in the 4th
class, is recovered at considerably less than half the expence of
81,791<i>l.</i> in the 1st class.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_185_195" id="Footnote_185_195"></a><a href="#FNanchor_185_195"><span class="label">[185]</span></a> It is to be observed, that the Debtors comprised, in
the first three classes mentioned in the <a href="#Footnote_184_194">foregoing note</a>, <a href="#Page_587">page 587</a>, are
generally the objects of imprisonment; while the bankrupt-laws relieve
the fourth, the insolvency of which class generally produces the
distress of the other; who must languish in a gaol and suffer a severe
punishment, although it is clear to demonstration, that the Debtor for
<i>ninety-nine</i> pounds is equally an object of commiseration as another
whose debt amounts to <i>one hundred</i>; and almost in the same degree
subject to accident and misfortune.
</p><p>
Under a System so contrary to reason, and so shocking to humanity, too
much praise cannot be bestowed on the founders and supporters of the
excellent Institution for the relief of honest, industrious persons
imprisoned for small debts. The immense number relieved by this
benevolent Society, who have appeared upon inquiry not to have brought
misfortunes upon themselves by imprudence, is one of the strongest
proofs that can be adduced of the imperfection of the laws; which are
tacitly acknowledged to be erroneous, in the case of every person who
is discharged by the bounty of the Public.</p></div>

nearly six years have elapsed since the passing of this Act. The
Public are, therefore, without the means of punishing or controlling
Watermen, which is felt as a serious misfortune.</p></div>

view; and may even go very far to stagger his belief: but when the
vast extent of the trade and commerce of London is considered, the
great quantity of money, Bank notes, and stationary or fixed property
of a portable nature, as well as moving effects, all which has been
estimated, exclusive of horses, cattle, corn, provender, fruit,
vegetables, &amp;c. at two hundred millions sterling, (<i>See p.</i> 605.) it
will cease to be a matter of surprise, that under an incorrect System
of Police and deficient Laws, the depredations are estimated so high.
It would have equally attracted attention with a view to an
improvement in the Police, and of course have answered the Author's
purpose full as well to have reduced the estimate to <i>one half the
present sum</i>: but being solicitous to approach as nearly to the truth
as possible, he considered himself bound to offer it in its present
form, which after being four years under the view of the Public, not
only stands unimpeached; but altho' the Author himself, after the
additional experience he has acquired, has attempted a new
modification; and although the River Plunder is greatly reduced, the
aggregate remains nearly as before.</p></div>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
